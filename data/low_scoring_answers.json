Guirassy also scored six goals in the same season, but the question asks for the most goals in a single season for Lille, and Remy's six goals came in more games (29) than Guirassy's (16) in the second tier. Therefore, Remy scored more goals in a single season for Lille than Guirassy.",

Therefore, we can infer that Rodgers currently manages Leicester City in the English Premier League. The length of Rodgers' tenure at Leicester City is not specified in the article, but according to transfermarkt.com, Rodgers has been the Leicester City manager since February 2019. This makes Leicester City the team for which Rodgers has managed the longest tenure in the English Premier League as of the publication date of the article.",
