So I think the club may be in a position, hopefully over the next week to two weeks, to maybe put a wee bit more information out.\"\nMartindale says the money still has to be found to help pay the court cases in which they were involved.\n\"Still got fires to fight,\" he said. \"Still got to find money for legal bills and X, Y and Z. There needs to be investment.\n\"But the chairman and the chief exec are working extremely hard and they've been fairly positive with the interest they've had in potential investors.\"\nMartindale has been Livingston manager since November 2020 but has worked with the West Lothian club since 2014, when he initially arrived as a volunteer.\nWhen asked if new ownership could mean his departure, Martindale said it would be up to those in charge to decide if they want him to stay.\n\"I'm genuinely really, really excited,\" he added. \"And, if people come in and it's time for me to go, I'll crack on. I'll be delighted at Livingstone's security future. I'll be over the moon.\n\"If you said to me, Davey, there's people coming in and you're not going to be here, you can be here and the people are not coming in, I would walk, I would walk tomorrow.\n\"I just want what's best for Livingston.

        "content": "Celtic beat Rangers to lift the Scottish Cup last season\nHeart of Midlothian and Aberdeen have already secured their places in the Scottish Cup semi-finals, but who will join them in the last four?\nHibernian host holders Celtic on Sunday before second tier Livingston welcome St Johnstone on Monday, live on BBC Scotland.\nHere's what to look out for...\nCup top scorer Daizen Maeda (right) has scored three times against Hibs this season\nThe enormity of Hibs' task on Sunday is highlighted by the fact they have not beaten Celtic at Parkhead in the Scottish Cup since their final success in 1902.\nHowever, on this occasion, they head to Celtic Park having triumphed over the cup holders and Scottish champions just last month, 2-1 at Easter Road in the Premiership.\nThat has contributed to a 15-game unbeaten run that has lifted David Gray's side to third in the table and they arrive in Glasgow fuelled by the pride of Sunday's derby win over Hearts.\nCeltic, though, have responded to that defeat by Hibs - and their narrow Champions League exit at the hands of Bayern Munich - by thrashing Aberdeen 5-1 and St Mirren 5-2.\nBrendan Rodgers' side remain unbeaten at home by a Scottish side since losing to Hearts in December 2023 and have beaten Hibs on their latest six visits to Celtic Park, the latest five by an aggregate on 19-4.\nIf they want to secure a rare consecutive win over the cup holders, they will no doubt have to shackle Daizen Maeda, who has embraced the added responsbility of leading the Celtic line following fellow Japan forward Kyogo Furuhashi exit to pick up the player of the month award.\nHe is also top scorer in the cup so far this season with four goals - and has three against Hibs this season already too.\nCeltic are unbeaten at home to Hibs in 20 meetings since a 2-1 defeat in January 2010, when Danny Galbraith scored a last-minute winner.\nHibs lost 2-0 at home to Rangers in the quarter-finals last season and last reached the semis in 2022, when they lost to Hearts.\nHibs last beat Celtic in the Scottish Cup in March 1986, 4-3 at Easter Road.\nCeltic defeated Hibs 3-1 at Celtic Park in the League Cup in August.\nHibs last beat Celtic twice in one season in 1992-93.\nCeltic beat Rangers in last season's final to lift the cup for a 42nd time.\nHibs won the Scottish Cup for a third time in 2016.\nAndrew Shinnie (right) scored Livingston's winner against St Johnstone last season\nNo wonder David Martindale thinks his Livingston side have \"more than a wee chance\" of knocking Premiership visitors St Johnstone out of the cup on Monday.\nThey have already sent one top-flight team - Ross County - packing this season and this time they have home advantage.\nNot only that, the visitors are three points adrift at the bottom, in danger of relegation, while Livingston are in the mix for a swift return to the Premiership.\nDraws with Partick Thistle and, on Wednesday, at home to Raith Rovers mean Martindale's side have dropped to third, three points behind Falkirk, but they remain unbeaten in 11 outings, including six at home.\nHowever, Saints will look to take positives from a draw away to Dundee on Saturday that prevented the second-bottom side extending the gap between them and Simo Valakari's improving side, who have now only lost twice in eight.\nA close encounter is on the cards in front of BBC Scotland television channel cameras before the live draw for the semi-finals.\nLivingston lost 4-2 away to eventual winners Celtic in the quarter-finals last season.\nThis is the furthest St Johnstone have gone in the cup since lifting the trophy for a second time in 2021.\nLivingston last reached the Scottish Cup semi-finals in 2004, losing to Dundee United.\nLivingston won the latest meeting between the sides, 2-1 at home in May, having drawn the previous three in their relegation season.\nLivingston are five unbeaten at home to Saints since a 2-1 defeat in February 2022.\nSaints won 2-0 in Perth in their latest Scottish Cup meeting with Livi in November 2013 and have won once in Livingston in the cup, 3-1 in February 1999."

But Roman was so impressed by Menon that he sent him to Chelsea's Cobham training ground with a brief to work with the first-team squad as the Premier League's first wellness coach.\n\"Roman asked for it to happen and it happened,\" Menon says.\n\"I was an Indian, who was never exposed to football, entering a massive club and it seemed impossible.\n\"There was a big barrier, but it was not an immovable rock because it came from the owner himself - he initiated that change so everyone was ready to try.\"\nAbramovich, pictured in 2009, bought Chelsea in a deal worth Â£140m in July 2003\nStill, the arrival of Menon and his philosophy was a culture shock for a squad who had finished as either Premier League champions or runners-up in the previous five seasons.\n\"We are talking about elite performance - change is always difficult,\" Menon says.\n\"Adding or taking away is always difficult, people don't want to change because they are already performing and winning. Why should they?\n\"Everyone treated me well but training the players wasn't easy initially. I should thank a few players, who were ready to try me.\"\nNone of the players were obliged to work with Menon. Instead his services were available if any felt they would be useful.\nStriker Didier Drogba quickly became Menon's key advocate.\n\"Didier was the initial one â Chelsea is like one big family and we just sat and ate in the canteen with the players and so we started a conversation organically while eating,\" says Menon.\n\"He asked what I can do for him, and I told him we can try this, and he asked me to try right away. That was the moment where football opened in front of me.\n\"After that Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, John Terry began coming to me to try it.\n\"The medical department were fantastic and made me part of their team, despite being from a different discipline.\"\nMenon's sessions involved meditation, sharpening players' mental approach and dispelling the negative thoughts that can come with top-flight pressure and scrutiny.\n\"I was a person without a title, teaching the players self-care and how to balance, spiritually, emotionally, and ultimately impact them physically,\" says Menon.\n\"They are human beings and need a friend to giggle with, babble to and then they will open up.\n\"You need to be happy in the mind in sports and business. Itâs the same â the mind is everything.\"\nMenon was a constant presence in the Chelsea backroom staff for 13 years, working under managers such as Carlo Ancelotti, Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho, Antonio Conte and, finally, Thomas Tuchel.\n\"I got the chance to be part of all the trophies Chelsea won from 2010,\" he says.\n\"What an experience, it was an unbelievable space, I miss it a lot, frankly.â\nMenon celebrates Chelsea's 2021 Champions League final win over Manchester City with then-Blues manager Thomas Tuchel\nMenon was part of a huge cull of Chelsea staff, notably in the medical department, when Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought the club in 2022 from Abramovich.\nAbramovich was forced to sell after being sanctioned for links to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\nThe upheaval at the club has coincided with a run of injuries among Chelsea's squad but Menon backs the new owners to stabilise the club.\n\"Change is inevitable in life,\" he says. \"The old regime had a lot of success and put a big mark on the club.\n\"Another management team came in which is very ambitious, very different, from a different region, understanding football on a different level.\n\"They need time to adapt, they are maybe in a sort of pre-season, I believe they will adapt. I worked with the new management and they are good.\n\"I wish them all the best; I am still a Chelsea fan and the club gave me everything I have.\"\nBelgium's World Cup campaign ended in the group stages at Qatar 2022, with Morocco and Croatia qualifying for the knockout rounds ahead of them\nMenon blazed a new trail in 2022, travelling to the World Cup as part of Roberto Martinez's Belgium staff.\nIndia â the most populous nation on earth â has never qualified for the tournament and Menon's presence caught the attention of his compatriots.\n\"This representation always helps my home country and the young generation to show that there is a career,\" he says.\n\"We can be in this arena. If you are not in as a player, at least in the backroom staff. Traditionally, in India most parents say you should first study and then play. I want to change that so study and play is 50/50. You need to follow your dreams.\"\nMenon believes infrastructure will need to change, along with mindset, if his home country is to become a factor on the international football scene.\n\"We are a country of 1.4bn people and the main problem is filtration,\" he adds.\n\"We need a minimum 100 grassroots level clubs to filter this. It is about structuring the grassroots level and schools.\nâIf you systemise it, we will have a team.\nâAt the last World Cup, many Indians were in Qatar and followed Messi and Ronaldo's journey. But we need a cultural change. Sports are important for the future, mental wellness, health, economy as well.\n\"I have had these conversations before in India and if my country needs me, I will always be there. I am sure sooner or later we will be at the World Cup.\"\nEast v West - Germany's drug-fuelled Cold War for medals\nThe air crash and the underdogs -  a triumph for a lost generation\nThe rise and fall of North Korea - the sleeping giant of women's football\nInside the gym building champions - and community\nChasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning"

        "title": "PSG's post-Mbappe era, no 'clans' and foreign stars' French buy-in",
        "content": "Paris St-Germain last reached the Champions League final in 2020\nRarely in the past decade and a half of Qatari ownership have Paris St-Germain entered the spring with this kind of confidence.\nOn Saturday evening, the runaway Ligue 1 leaders wasted little time in dismantling a Lille side who also had a midweek Champions League tie to look forward to, scoring four goals in what manager Luis Enrique would later call the team's \"best half of the season\".\nVictory against Les Dogues, who could only muster a consolation goal through Jonathan David 10 minutes from time, was more than simply a dress rehearsal before Liverpool's visit to the French capital on Wednesday for the first leg of their last-16 tie.\nLille, who have notably beaten both Real and Atletico Madrid in Europe this season, were swept aside as PSG continued their seemingly inevitable march towards completing an unbeaten campaign on home soil.\nThe all-conquering form of a rejuvenated PSG would have seemed unlikely at the start of the season.\nWhile the post-Kylian Mbappe era arguably started midway through last season, given that the France captain was mostly spared for high-profile matches at that point, replacing his output and leading role remained the major uncertainty on the eve of the new campaign.\nThat task was made all the more pressing by the absence of a centre-forward in name during most of the autumn.\nPortuguese international Goncalo Ramos was sidelined for three months with an ankle injury, while Randal Kolo Muani was progressively phased out of the team, eventually culminating in his loan move to Juventus this winter.\nInitially, it was Bradley Barcola, from the left wing, who took up the mantle by scoring 10 times in the first 11 league games of the campaign.\nHaving carried over his goalscoring form to international duty amid Mbappe's absence from Les Bleus, the 22-year-old was looking increasingly at ease in carrying the now-Real Madrid man's responsibilities for club and country.\nHis form only faintly translated to Champions League fixtures, though, as was the case for the rest of the team. Successive false-nine experiments, notably involving Kang-in Lee and Ousmane Dembele, were proving mostly ineffective as the team registered just one win in the first five European matchdays.\nThe team's league stage campaign, branded by Enrique \"unjust\" given the tough draw they faced, was stunted by an inability to capitalise on their dominance in possession in most matches.\nA disastrous early exit in January was an increasingly credible prospect, until the pieces of the Spaniard's plan finally began to fall into place.\nThe Parisians' free-scoring run since January has included 18 goals in four European encounters, a figure admittedly inflated by Brest's unfortunate collapse in their play-off tie.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nOusmane Dembele has the highest amount of goal involvements in Ligue 1 this season\nLeading the reversal in fortunes has been Dembele's newly found confidence in front of goal, with the 27-year-old finally realising the potential of his talent.\nThe France international, despite arguably being the face of the club with Mbappe gone, has scarcely been given any kind of preferential treatment.\nHis reinvention has been all the more unlikely given what was an ostensibly fraught rapport with his manager only a few months ago.\nHe was notably dropped for the trip to face Arsenal in October, for arriving late to training, a move which Enrique later branded more recently as \"the best thing I've done to him\".\nAfter a needless sending off in the defeat by Bayern Munich, Dembele was again relegated to the bench for the following league games.\nTensions were eventually appeased, though, as the former Barcelona player worked his way back into the team and claimed the unlikely false-nine role as his own.\nWith 18 goals across all competitions since the turn of the year, the 27-year-old has scored more in two months than any single season of his to date.\nWhile his talent has seldom been called into question, Dembele has, virtually overnight, managed to erase the erratic decision-making, which plagued the first decade of his career.\n\"It's a bit of everything. It's down to my positioning, but also a change in mentality,\" the forward told the Ligue 1 broadcaster on Saturday night.\nDembele's purple patch has also been aided by the team of young talents around him suddenly clicking into gear.\nThe pivot away from buying established names hasn't necessarily meant a decrease in activity in the transfer window, though.\nLast summer's arrivals of teenagers Joao Neves and Doue, along with Ecuadorian centre-back Willian Pacho, did not come cheap, and Kvaratskhelia's signing from Napoli cost the Parisians a reported 70m euros (Â£58m).\nLuis Enrique extended his contract as Paris St-Germain head coach until 2027\nGone are the \"clans\" that divided past PSG squads, with Enrique now able to mould a team of young (and evidently willing) talents around his philosophy.\nOf those who started in last weekend's hard-fought win in Lyon, only the 30-year-old Marquinhos was older than 26. Impressively, virtually all of the new arrivals from abroad have had little issue giving post-match interviews in French.\nFew in the team encapsulate the willingness to integrate and adapt according to the team's needs better than Neves. The creative-minded midfielder, while standing out as part of a three-man block alongside the equally impressive Vitinha, has filled in more than serviceably at both right-back and left-back when called upon.\nThe Benfica academy product, who has set up nine goals in all competitions this season, has displayed a technical ease in slicing through defences and evading pressure only rivalled by his compatriot.\nHis assist for Dembele against Lille, setting up the Frenchman despite finding himself virtually face-to-face with goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, was emblematic of his selfless, all-action displays since arriving.\nNot all of the summer recruits hit the ground running straight away. French youth international Doue had already established himself as one of the continent's most promising talents even before joining from Rennes this summer, but a limited impact in his first few months in the capital drew increasing criticism over the necessity of his costly arrival.\nAn impressive display against Salzburg in December, though, was the catalyst for Doue's increased involvement and upturn in form.\nThe 19-year-old was key in three of PSG's four goals against Lille on Saturday, adding his name onto the scoresheet with a strike into the top corner.\nAt ease both on the wing and further back in midfield, Doue has bounced back from an uncertain start to life in the capital.\nBarcola has also bounced back from a dip in form during the winter months, perhaps aided by the fact that the goalscoring burden is now shared across the frontline.\nKhvicha Kvaratskhelia is the first Georgian player to score in the knockout stages of the Champions League\nThe arrival of fierce competition in Kvaratskhelia in January also appears to have kick-started his output again, with his tally now standing at 17 goals and 11 assists this term.\nSitting behind the team's impressive firepower, though, is also a defence with new-found assurance. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, for instance, has appeared increasingly reliable and comfortable with the ball at his feet, far from the high-profile errors of past European campaigns.\nBarring some rare lapses in concentration, the 23-year-old Pacho has adapted seamlessly to the physically demanding nature of Ligue 1 after joining from Eintracht Frankfurt.\nHis composure and workrate in particular have complemented captain Marquinhos more effectively than the more experienced centre-backs PSG have signed over the past few years.\nHaving mostly seen off domestic opposition since their upturn in form, Wednesday night's game against Premier League leaders LIverpool will be the sternest test yet.\n\"It could have been a Champions League final,\" as the PSG manager noted on Saturday.\nThe Asturian is right to view the tie as a clash of equals."

        "content": "Luke Williams won 17 of his 53 Swansea league games, with 11 draws and 25 defeats\nNobody will be more disappointed about Luke Williams' departure from Swansea City than the man himself.\nWilliams walked away from Notts County to try his luck at Swansea after the Welsh club eventually turned to him having failed to appoint Chris Davies as successor to Michael Duff.\nThis was Williams' chance to prove himself in the Championship, to show that he could cut it at a club attempting to swim with some much bigger fish in the second tier.\nWith Swansea in dire form and Williams gone after a little more than 13 months in charge, those looking on from outside may judge that he has failed.\nThe counter argument, however, is that Williams was not the problem.\nAs the head coach, he has paid the price for an alarming slump in form which has Swansea glancing nervously towards the bottom three with 13 league fixtures remaining.\nAs the old line goes, you cannot sack the players.\nAndy Coleman, Swansea's under-fire chairman, is presumably not about to jettison himself, either, while the club's director of football, Richard Montague, cannot carry the can for the club's dreadful run given that he does not start work until Tuesday.\nThe fact that Montague, who had success working with Williams at Notts County, arrives at Swansea the day after his old Meadow Lane colleague departs says something about the muddle his new club finds itself in.\nWilliams' exit had seemed increasingly possible with almost every game that has gone by in recent weeks, aside from the gutsy victory over Bristol City eight days ago.\nSadly for Swansea, success at Ashton Gate was followed by losses against Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City.\nDefeat by Stoke, another struggling side, proved to be the last stand for Williams, who will leave with a feeling of what might have been.\nWas Williams properly backed during his time at Swansea? Did he have the tools to mould a team capable of competing on a consistent basis in the Championship?\nThe likelihood is that he would say no.\nSwansea were 16th in the second tier when he arrived in January 2024, midway through what was an arduous season.\nThe previous summer, Swansea had replaced Russell Martin with Duff who, alongside sporting director Paul Watson, brought in 13 new players.\nDuff was gone inside five months, Watson lasted only 16 months in his job and the majority of their signings did not come off.\nThere were some difficult days in the early stages of Williams' reign, with Swansea taking time to adapt as he attempted to restore a possession-based style while delivering points.\nYet they eventually secured Championship survival with something to spare, finishing 2023-24 in 14th with Williams looking ahead with optimism to last summer's transfer window.\nOnce again, however, Swansea's business has proved questionable.\nThe two players Williams wanted most were striker Tyrese Campbell, a free agent following his exit from Stoke, and West Brom midfielder John Swift, who he had worked with at Swindon Town.\nThe two players would have been high earners in Swansea terms, in a bracket with Matt Grimes.\nSwansea have struggled to adjust to the loss of Matt Grimes\nAs a result they did not arrive, with Swansea's hierarchy opting instead to sign young players with development potential from cheaper foreign markets. As yet, most of those players are yet to prove their worth.\nSwansea's issues are not all down to last summer's new recruits, who joined a squad lacking depth in almost every department.\nA lack of firepower, in particular, has been a problem throughout this campaign.\nWilliams had hoped reinforcements would arrive in January, but was instead left bemoaning the club's recruitment work after another botched transfer window.\nTwo years on from Martin's memorable post-January press conference, there was a feeling of deja vu.\nIn the end, Swansea's most notable piece of January business by some distance was to sell Grimes, the club captain and Williams' most influential player, to Coventry City.\nWilliams is an open book, a coach who would not hide his feelings when facing the media, and his frustration was obvious.\nThe same was true after almost every Swansea game in 2025, with their collapse eventually leading him to the exit door.\nHead coach Williams leaves Swansea\nWilliams feels pressure as Swansea slump goes on\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\nAfter victory over Luton Town on 29 December, Swansea were four points adrift of the play-offs in ninth place and playing bright, attacking football.\nThey had won six of their previous 12 games and looked capable of a top-half finish, which would have been a significant achievement given the club's budget and resources.\nSince then, however, they have produced relegation form.\nThe start of the slump coincided with speculation linking Williams with a move to West Bromwich Albion.\nWilliams' failure to kill off speculation immediately harmed his relationship with some Swansea supporters.\nAs a result, perhaps, there was less patience among some sections of the fanbase as Williams' team lurched from one poor result to another during January and February.\nAfter seven defeats in the past nine league matches â as well as an FA Cup loss at Southampton â Williams knew he was on thin ice before news of his departure came on Monday afternoon.\nAndy Coleman will again lead Swansea's search for a head coach having previously appointed Michael Duff and Luke Williams\nEach Swansea loss prompted a flurry of criticism on social media, with Williams blamed for the failings of a squad who have not been able to deliver any consistency this season.\nAnd so the reins are handed to Alan Sheehan, the assistant head coach who was brought in by Watson and takes caretaker charge of Swansea for a second time.\nHe did a decent job following Duff's dismissal 15 months ago, securing 11 points from seven games in charge, and Swansea need something similar now as they look to stave off the threat of relegation.\nColeman, meantime, will set about trying to find Williams' long-term successor, presumably with a helping hand from Montague.\nThe challenge will be to find a coach capable of getting results while playing attractive football with a squad built on one of the smaller budgets in the Championship.\nIt will be no easy task."

We've been keen to get [Cristian] Romero back and his first pass shows he's not played for three months. Some of it is just anxiety and nervousness which we need to get under control.\n\"I think Micky van de Ven, Dom and Romero are quality players and we've hardly had them all year. It gives the team a bit of a boost to see them out there.\"\nTottenham have won just one of their past 10 Premier League fixtures at home\nPositivity has been in scarce supply at Spurs this season but they could still win European silverware.\nIn September, after losing 1-0 against Arsenal in the north London derby, Postecoglou said \"I always win things in my second year\".\nTottenham have since crashed out of the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, while they are 36 points adrift of Premier League leaders Liverpool.\nThe Europa League offers Postecoglou one final chance to deliver on that statement as the club seeks a first trophy since 2008.\nSpurs cruised through the group phase of the revamped Europa League, finishing fourth, but have work to do to reach the quarter-finals after a flat performance when losing 1-0 at AZ Alkmaar.\nThey registered just a single shot on target in the Netherlands and will need a vastly improved performance to get through.\nHowever, Tottenham boast a strong home record in the competition this campaign, winning three and drawing one, while they have kept three clean sheets.\n\"I don't preach from the altar, people are allowed to feel the way they do,\" said Postecoglou.\n\"Playing away at AZ, they certainly helped their team and we'd like to think on Thursday we will make it just as hostile for the opposition.\""

        "content": "Liverpool and Crystal Palace have both played in the Women's Championship\nCould relegation be scrapped in the Women's Super League and could both the top tier and Women's Championship be expanded?\nThe answer is yes, with nothing off the table as the company overseeing the top two  leagues of women's football proposes a bold restructuring of the pyramid.\nA vote will take place at the end of the season, in May. So what changes could we see, how do clubs feel about them and what impact could they have?\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nWomen's Football Weekly: Managerial mayhem and no more WSL relegation?\nRepresentatives from all 23 clubs across the WSL and Women's Championship attended a quarterly meeting last Friday.\nAmong the topics discussed was the suggestion to temporarily scrap relegation in the WSL, but still allow one club a season to earn promotion from the second tier.\nThe idea is that expanding the league would improve competitiveness, while clubs would be given stability - which in turn would encourage long-term investment.\nA two-thirds majority vote, to be taken by all clubs in both tiers, will be needed in May for the change to be made.\nThe proposals are still being refined but one, according to the Guardian,, external would lead to relegation being scrapped for four seasons, from the 2026-27 campaign, as part of a gradual plan to expand both the top flight and Championship to 16 teams.\nSources have told BBC Sport that several clubs in the bottom half of the WSL are in support of the idea, as they believe it would give them a better chance to compete in the future.\nIn recent seasons, the promoted Championship club has needed to immediately spend at least Â£2m just to provide the necessary infrastructure, staffing requirements and player wages to meet the WSL's 'participation agreement'.\nCrystal Palace are currently four points adrift at the bottom of the WSL table, meaning the club promoted from the Championship could be relegated at the first time of asking for a second year in a row - after Bristol City last season.\nMeanwhile, sources at clubs higher up in the table - that are yet to break into the top four - believe that if their future in the WSL was secure, it could encourage owners to invest more in elite facilities and girls' academies.\nClubs could potentially offer more long-term player contracts and salaries as a result of that stability.\nHowever, those opposed to the idea feel it is against the fundamental values of English football, and there could be a risk that clubs neglect their women's teams because there is no jeopardy of relegation.\nManchester City manager Gareth Taylor said he wants to \"keep it simple\".\n\"Promotion and relegation are always going to be what supporters and teams play for. I think that really is going to be difficult to move away from,\" he added.\nWest Ham manager Rehanne Skinner says the existence of promotion and relegation provides an \"incentive\".\nHowever, she says there are \"loads of different factors\" and clubs need to weigh up the \"pros and cons\" before any vote is passed.\nIf the majority threshold is reached, the WPLL (Women's Professional League Limited) and shareholders can then move on to the next stage, which would be to confirm details on how the restructure would work and a time frame.\nAs well as scrapping relegation, other proposals could include a closed league - where promotion would not occur, although this looks less likely.\nThere could also be play-offs introduced in the Championship.\nAnd they would also decide if relegation were to be scrapped temporarily, when it would be reinstated.\n\"There is potentially a growth stage we are going through where we would need to make sure all clubs are investing to be competitive,\" said Skinner.\n\"If the league were to be closed, given the number of teams in it at the moment, I don't think that is appropriate. The league has got to be bigger.\n\"There would have to be mandatory investment and maintenance of that, otherwise it could discredit the quality of the league - 'to be in it for being in its sake'.\n\"I don't see it as a bad thing. The game is evolving, things need to be reviewed as to what happens next, but it comes with criteria.\"\nAs part of the proposal, sources say there could be a minimum investment criteria, while there are discussions over introducing higher minimum wages.\nAnother debate would be regarding which clubs remain in the WSL.\nFor example, would clubs apply to join the WSL by proving their investment - as they did in 2018 - or would it be determined by sporting performance?\nWhat else could be introduced?\nLike in the men's game, there have been questions about whether Scottish clubs Rangers and Celtic could join England's top league, however, there is no suggestion that will happen any time soon.\nFollowing Chelsea's spending in the January transfer window - when they broke the world transfer record to sign USA defender Naomi Girma for Â£900,000, as well as a big-money move for England international Keira Walsh from Barcelona - the introduction of a financial fair play regulation could be an option.\nIn January, Women's Championship clubs Bristol City, Southampton, Birmingham and Newcastle agreed to take part in a trial allowing fans to drink alcohol in the stands. That could become commonplace in England if successful.\nThe WPLL could also look to the National Women's Soccer League in the US and propose a draft system for signing players, or bring in salary caps.\nThe WSL currently has a \"soft\" salary cap, allowing clubs to spend up to 40% of their revenue on player salaries.\nAll-in-all, there is plenty for WSL board members to consider, and scrapping relegation is just one of many proposals that could come their way.\n'Beyond her years' - world record signing Girma, by those who know her"

They had about four or five players that went down,\" Hume told BBC Radio Newcastle.\n\"The fans got up from it and we pushed on and ended up getting the equaliser so it kind of helped us in a way.

        "content": "Celtic have lost just one game this season, defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League\nOn a day of six goals, 11 bookings, 12 substitutions and 120 minutes of cup final bonkerdom, into penalties they went.\nChests were wheezing, legs cramping, hearts fluttering, rain falling. \"Carnage, just carnage\" as the Celtic defender Liam Scales said in the aftermath.\nThe tension, the drama, the lost-soul demeanour of Ridvan Yilmaz as he walked back to the halfway line having had his penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel.\nThe sight of Jack Butland, the Rangers goalkeeper, then having to score against Schmeichel to keep his team alive in the shoot-out, which he did.\nThen the suspense as Daizen Maeda stood over that last kick, the big opportunity to finally put a gallant Rangers to sleep, which he took. Unerringly.\nMaeda carries himself like a man who laughs in the face of pressure, who pokes a finger in the eye of stressful situations such as this. At no point did you really get a feeling that he was going to miss.\nThat's not being wise after the event. This was in real time. Maeda looked like he was in his element.  He was oh so cool in the final seconds of a final that for big chunks reached epic proportions.\nCeltic beat Rangers on penalties after epic\nMore Celtic reaction & have your say\nWhat are they saying in the Rangers camp?\nRangers looked stunned and sickened, as well they might. Of all the blows that Celtic have inflicted on them in recent seasons, this has to be the most painful.\nWorse, surely, than last season's Scottish Cup final, secured at the death by Adam Idah. That had been a scrap. On that day, Rangers hadn't delivered anything like the goals and moments they came up with on Sunday.\nMore grievous than the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2023 won by Jota? For sure.\nMore sickening in its own way than the 3-0s and 4-0s visited upon them in the time of Ange Postecoglou and earlier this season? You have to think so. Those were heavy beatings with no excruciating what-might-have-beens attached.\nRegret was the difference.\nAt 1-0 at Hampden on Sunday, and with Celtic a rattled version of their usual selves, Rangers broke free and had a four-on-one. Hamza Igamane was in control of the ball with men running free outside him.\nHad he made the right decision, it was a one-on-one with Schmeichel from point-blank range. He didn't. He made a bad call. Sliding doors. A possible 2-0 went begging.\nThere was more. Three minutes into the first period of extra time, Scales tugged Vaclav Cerny so microscopically close to the penalty box that Philippe Clement complained later about a lack of VAR intervention. He had a point.\nRangers folk may feel tortured by those what-if moments as much as the missed penalty much later on.\nAs Celtic lifted the trophy, most Rangers fans had already exited, presumably having had a bellyful of disappointment for one day. Only Butland and Cyriel Dessers took it in from the touchline. Suckers for punishment, perhaps.\nThis video can not be played\nClement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident\nRangers had a checklist of things that they had to get right to make a proper final of this and one by one they ticked them off.\nScore first - they did it having not done it in their previous six games against Celtic.\nIt was their first goal against Rodgers' team in more than four hours of football, the first time they were ahead against Celtic in more than nine hours.\nWhat else was on their must-do sheet?\nShut down the wounding influence of McGregor - they did that.\nShow ruthlessness in front of goal - yes.\nSilence Kyogo Furuahshi - done.\nBring the intensity and work rate and aggression and character of Thursday against Tottenham to Hampden - achieved, with bells and whistles attached.\nTick, tick, tick. Character? They had it in spades.\nWhen Greg Taylor, villain turned hero, and then Maeda transformed a 0-1 into a 2-1, it looked like Celtic had finally got hold of things. We thought we knew which way this was heading at that point, but we hadn't a clue.\nNicolas Raskin and Mohamed Diomande had put in towering performances in hustling and harrying and living in the face of a Celtic midfield that has brought ruination to their door so often - and it was Diomande who levelled.\nWith 15 minutes of normal time left, it was 2-2. With three minutes left, it was 3-2 Celtic.\nTwenty one seconds after the restart it was 3-3, Danilo's header extending the final and hammering home the point that Rangers have found something of late, a bit of steel and a bit of belief. But no trophy to go with it.\nThis video can not be played\n'Most important thing is being on the podium at the end' - Rodgers\nIncredibly, McGregor has never lost a cup final, but \"it was mighty close today,\" he said. The captain was as relieved as he was honest.\n\"The performance wasn't great, so we had to grind it out. We had to hold our nerve. Even when you're not perfect, you can still win. Dig in. Find something extra.\"\nPyro, predictably, reappeared and kick-off was delayed, two more fingers being raised by the ultras to their own clubs and to the footballing authorities who practically begged them to behave. More charges pending from the SPFL? Let's see.\nWhen the action began, it was toe-to-toe. Rangers were physical and uncompromising.\nAmid the maelstrom, Taylor lost his head, played a square ball that was a bad idea and also poorly executed in any event and that was the catalyst for the opener.\nThe omens were good for Rangers. Only four teams who have scored first in the last 49 League Cup finals have failed to win the trophy. But stats don't take into account Celtic's steepling self belief.\nThey were in trouble - no space, no control, not many chances - but they found their way out of it. Celtic's mental strength is a thing of wonder. They were nowhere near their best and yet they have another title to their name.\nThe shoot-out came and with it came memories of Rangers' in the Europa League denouement in Seville against Eintracht Frankfurt. Aaron Ramsey, then. Yilmaz now.\nSchmeichel did his thing. There was gamesmanship in the way he tried to put off some Rangers penalty takers. There were some mocking words in reply from Ianis Hagi after he buried his kick past the Dane.\nUltimately, this odyssey came down to Yilmaz versus Schmeichel and Maeda versus Butland. Celtic won, by a whisker or by a mile, it doesn't really matter.\nA different kind of victory from before, but the same feelgood in one dressing room and presumably the same silence and despair in the other. Sporting drama at its best ."

        "content": "This video can not be played\n'It's all boiling over' - Cunha sees red for violent conduct\nAn FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Bournemouth was a disappointing blow for Wolves, but the impact of losing star forward Matheus Cunha for at least three Premier League matches may hurt even more.\nThe 25-year-old had to be dragged down the tunnel and was unable to take part in the penalty shootout following his red card in the final minute of extra time for an unsavoury clash with Cherries defender Milos Kerkez.\nWolves boss Vitor Pereira said: \"Of course, the emotional side was very high and not only inside the pitch, but on the bench and in the stands, a lot of pressure everywhere. In the end it happens.\n\"It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football.\"\nBoth Matt Doherty and Boubacar Traore missed spot-kicks for Wolves in the 5-4 shootout defeat after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes at Vitality Stadium.\nIt was a dramatic climax to a game where Evanilson had put the Cherries ahead on his return from injury, before his fellow Brazilian Cunha levelled with a sensational equaliser from around 30 yards.\nHowever, Cunha's display went from magical to madness with a dismissal that will leave his side - fourth bottom in the Premier League - without their best player for crucial games in their relegation fight.\nThe red-mist moment, where he clashed multiple times with Kerkez, including fighting, kicking out at the Hungarian full-back while he was on the ground and aiming a headbutt when Kerkez had got back to his feet.\nAfter being pulled away by team-mates, referee Sam Barrott eventually gave him a red card but a furious Cunha refused to leave the field, needing to be escorted and pushed down the tunnel.\nHe will be suspended for three games following the red card for violent conduct, but additional games cannot be ruled out because of the severity of the incident and having already served a two-match ban for clashing with Ipswich Town security in December.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Match of the Day: \"The ability he has is top level, the goal he scored belongs in the Champions League, but then suddenly we see the ugly.\n\"I have not seen that on the football pitch since the 1970s - he just lost it. The referee had to send him off. They couldn't get him out of the ground. This was the ugly part and it is something he has to stop.\n\"Wolves need points to stay up. He will be a huge loss.\"\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?\nWolves have what could be described as a favourable run of fixtures coming up against teams in the bottom half of the Premier League.\nBut Cunha is certain to miss matches against Everton, bottom club Southampton and West Ham, while third-bottom Ipswich follow on 5 April.\nWolves have built a five-point buffer over Ipswich and Leicester City after winning two of their past four league matches.\nBut losing talisman Cunha will be a massive blow, given he is their top league scorer on 13 goals and their attacking inspiration in this troubled campaign.\nCunha was sent off in the 120th minute of the match in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vitality Stadium\nCunha has been linked with a big-money move over the past year with Europe's top clubs keen, but he may be viewed as a loose cannon because of his antics.\nAs well as his aggressive display at Bournemouth, in an unsavoury incident earlier in the season, Cunha elbowed a member of the Ipswich Town staff before snatching his glasses off his face at the end of their game at Molineux. He received a two-match ban and was fined Â£80,000.\nThe Brazil forward is known to have a Â£62.5m release clause in place which may also put off suitors looking to secure a summer transfer.\nWolves boss Pereira told BBC Match of the Day: \"When the situation happened I was looking for the ball.\n\"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today. Not only inside the pitch, but outside [the pitch]. With a lot of pressure, and in the end these are things that can happen.\n\"You know now he is frustrated, he is better in my opinion. I never speak to the team when we are nervous or frustrated. It is better to wait one day and think about everything. After we can have a talk.\n\"Of course, he is an important player, but next game we play with 11 and start with 11.\"\nSpeaking in his post-match news conference, he added: \"Matheus is a special player and today he played extra time. The last three weeks he has a problem in the hamstring and he tried.\n\"I didn't see the situation. Don't ask me about it because I was looking at the other end. In the end the referee decided the red card.\"\nAsked about whether Cunha deserves another chance, Pereira added: \"Of course, he is important but I cannot speak about what I don't know. It is important to check the situation, to look for what happened because I was looking for the other side.\n\"The others say to me he kick, he punch, he do what he did with the head and the player went to hospital? No, OK. But it is a situation that cannot happen of course.\n\"To judge the situation, I must have the clear image in my mind.\"\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola criticised the decision to show Kerkez a yellow card in the Cunha clash. It was was the defender's second in this season's FA Cup and means he will be banned from playing in the quarter-final tie.\n\"Milos Kerkez has received a yellow card for adopting an aggressive attitude,\" said Iraola. \"After what they have done to Milos Kerkez, they should reward him because [of] the attitude he has.\n\"They punch him, they kick him on the floor, they headbutt him and he doesn't react! You punish this? I will have to say to Milos [that] probably I cannot do as well as a player.\n\"The prize is they show him a yellow card and he will not play the quarter-final. Yes, I am very disappointed with the refereeing.\"\nLatest Wolves news, analysis and fan views\nGet Wolves news sent straight to your phone"

        "title": "'Unacceptable' that Rangers did not get penalty - Collum",
        "content": "This video can not be played\nRangers manager Philippe Clement commented on the lack of a penalty award in Sunday's League Cup final loss\nVAR officials made a ''really, really poor'' and \"unacceptable\" decision not to award Rangers a penalty against Celtic in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, admits Scottish FA head of referee operations Willie Collum.\nThe Ibrox side, who lost the final on penalties after a 3-3 draw, were awarded a free-kick in extra time when Liam Scales was penalised by referee John Beaton for a pull on Vaclav Cerny right on the edge of the Celtic box.\nFootage shows that the infringement started outside the area but continued inside the 18-yard box.\nCollum has said VAR officials Alan Muir and assistant Frank Connor moved \"far too quickly\" in their analysis of the incident and were \"not forensic enough\".\n\"People will obviously hear me say that it's wrong, but that's not enough,\" he said on the Scottish FA's VAR Review show., external\n\"We need to now understand why did we get it wrong and how do we make things better, how do we improve, what's the lessons learned from this incident, because people will find it very hard to accept this error.\n\"It's a really, really poor decision. It's an unacceptable decision. The VAR team know that, everyone in refereeing knows it.\nSFA chief concedes 'decisions will be wrong'\nClement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident\nCeltic beat Rangers on penalties to win epic six-goal League Cup final\nThe Scottish FA has also broadcast the conversation between the officials in which Muir says to Connor: ''The [pulling] is outside [the box]. Do you agree?''\nCollum says the question should not have been framed in such a closed manner and that the penalty award was so obvious that there was no need to recommend an on field review by referee Beaton.\nNeither Muir or Connor will be on duty at matches this weekend.\n\"We will do our very, very best through our coaching, through our analysis, to make sure an incident like this never happens again,\" Collum added. \"But it's a mistake, it's a bad mistake.\n\"When you look at the TV pictures, this is not a difficult decision for the VAR team. They are not forensic enough in the analysis. They move far too quickly.\n\"I think they're thrown because the majority of the Rangers player's body is outside the area but that's irrelevant because it's the holding that they should be judging.\n\"They should be making sure they get a clear image to show them that continues into the penalty area.\"\nAddressing the Cerny and Scales incident in more detail, Collum said: \"There's been a lot said about the Rangers player having a foot on penalty line. The foot is irrelevant. It's about the holding only because that's where the contact is.\n\"The holding begins outside the penalty area and then it continues on the line and even arguably beyond the line and fully into the penalty area. But, regardless, the fact it's on the line, this should be considered as a penalty kick.\n\"The referee's awarded the free-kick on the field, he sees the pulling, he's correctly judged the incident in terms of the foul play.\n\"But then the VAR team need to go into a check and decide whether this incident is inside or outside and ultimately, they failed to come to the correct conclusion, which is this should have been a factual overturn.\n\"There's no need for the referee to go to the monitor - a factual overturn for a penalty kick to be awarded.\"\nRangers noted \"the Scottish FA's admission of an officiating failure following the non-award of a penalty\".\nAnd the club added: \"For such a failure to occur during one of Scotland's showcase matches is not only hugely disappointing for the club and its supporters, but also damaging for the credibility of Scottish football more widely.\n\"We acknowledge the Scottish FA's determination to use this and other decision-making failures as opportunities to drive improvements in officiating standards.\n\"As a club, we will continue to engage with the Scottish FA in an attempt to improve officiating standards for the benefit of all clubs in Scotland.\"\nCollum backed the decision to dismiss Robbie Deas for his challenge on Hearts' Kenneth Vargas in Kilmarnock's 1-0 Scottish Premiership win on Sunday.\nFurthermore, he said downgrading a red card for St Mirren's Alex Gogic following his tackle on Aberdeen's Shayden Morris was also the right call in the Paisley side's  2-1 win in November.\nFurthermore, Collum agreed with the decision not to award Rangers a penalty for a suspected handball by St Johnstone's Jack Sanders at McDiarmid Park in early December, which the visitors won 1-0.\nHowever, Collum said there should have been an on-field review of Dundee United goalkeeper Jack Walton's booking for a foul on St Mirren forward Toyosi Olusanya and a red card recommended in United's 2-0 win in November.\nThe referee head believed Aberdeen defender Jack Milne should have been dismissed for a challenge on Hearts midfielder Beni Baningime in their 1-1 draw on 1 December."

        "content": "Liam Rosenior's Strasbourg visit Will Still's Lens on Sunday\nAs Thomas Tuchel prepares to become the third foreign manager to lead England men's football team, two young English coaches forging a name for themselves are set to meet this weekend in one of Europe's top leagues.\nWill Still and Liam Rosenior will go head-to-head on Sunday not in the Premier League, but in France's Ligue 1 when Lens host Strasbourg at the Stade Bollaert-Delilis.\nThey are two of just six British coaches currently managing in Europe's top five leagues, the others all in the English top flight: Eddie Howe, David Moyes, Graham Potter and Kieran McKenna.\nThis will be the second meeting between the pair, following a 2-2 draw in October when Strasbourg twice came from behind to earn a point.\n\"I think his Strasbourg team entertains people and people enjoy watching them in France,\" Still, 32, tells BBC Sport. \"I know he's done really well and he did an unbelievable job at Hull and he's doing it again here.\"\nRosenior was equally complimentary.\n\"He's got a really distinct style of play and he's very respected in this country so I'm looking forward to playing against him,\" says the 40-year-old.\n\"I would say tactically he's very strong. [They] gave us a really difficult game and I'm really looking forward to the next one.\"\nThomas Tuchel will be the England men's team's third foreign coach, after Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello\nTuchel's appointment as England boss in 2024 was not universally welcomed and raised some important questions: why did the Football Association look overseas? And what does the German's appointment say about the pathways open to English and British managers at the highest levels of the game?\nThe Premier League is the richest league in the sport, attracting the best talent both on and off the field. Yet when it comes to managers, there are only 20 jobs available.\nStill and Rosenior have followed strikingly different paths to earn their chances in the French top flight.\nRosenior, who previously managed Derby County and Hull City, is a former pro turned coach, while Still became a head coach at the tender age of 24 in Belgium.\n\"I've always wanted to see what it was like,\" says Rosenior about coaching abroad. \"I wasn't good enough for clubs abroad to want to take me as a player so to have this opportunity now I absolutely love.\n\"Strasbourg just seemed like a perfect fit, a great challenge for me and one I'm really enjoying.\"\nStill, who began his managerial career at Lierse, adds: \"Ligue 1 is a big competition. It's tough.\n\"There are a lot of good teams. I know it's sort of looked down a bit but there are really good teams and really good coaches with great ideas.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFrom Football Manager to football manager\nBoth Still and Rosenior are thriving but the fact there are so few British coaches operating in Europe's top five leagues suggests there is a problem.\nBy contrast, Serie A features 16 Italian coaches, La Liga has 14 Spanish coaches, the Bundesliga has 10 German coaches and Ligue 1 has nine French coaches.\n\"[It's] the opportunities,\" says Still. \"And by opportunities I mean: do we have enough coaches going through the badges? Are the badges accessible and easy to get on and once we've got the badges are there enough opportunities at clubs?\n\"Does the outside world look at English coaches as a real option? There's a load of top Spanish coaches, top Portuguese coaches, top Dutch, German coaches but can we push that barrier as well?\"\nRosenior adds: \"I look at the German model. They've got some outstanding young German coaches. We have one coaching our national team, which is fantastic.\n\"What you see - and this is over the last 10 years - is that they have younger coaches who have been given opportunities in the Bundesliga.\n\"They've been more exposed to that level earlier, so maybe that's something we can look at. But, for me, it's not about the nationality of a manager, it's about the qualities that they bring.\"\nWith just 20 managerial spots available does the Premier League feel a bit of a closed shop?\n\"Sometimes,\" says Still. \"But it's difficult to sort of have a grasp or a proper sense of what the reality is.\n\"I don't know what those Premier League clubs are thinking. I don't know how they're working. I don't know what their next step in their recruitment process is.\n\"It's the best league in the world for a reason so you've got to be one of the best in the world and that's what I think we all aspire to do.\"\nRosenior sees it somewhat differently.\n\"I think it depends on what your ultimate goal is,\" he says. \"My ultimate goal isn't to be in the Premier League.\n\"I don't think football is a linear thing where you say, 'Right, I worked in the Championship, I'm going to go to the Premier League'.\n\"My ultimate goal is to be the best coach I can be and it's up to the decision makers at each football club to pick who they think the right coach is for their club.\"\nThere was a time when few British players ventured overseas, but the numbers are growing season upon season. Should British coaches seek to do similar?\n\"I think it's a great experience,\" says Still \"I think learning about different cultures, different ways of playing the game, different opposition, different players. I'd definitely encourage it because you open yourself up to a lot more.\"\nRosenior adds: \"It's not for me to say to anyone where they should take their careers. And it's not about nationality. It's just about being the best person you can be and working as hard as you can every day.\"\nBoth Rosenior and Still have worked exceptionally hard to get to where they are right now in their careers and the decisions they have made have set them on a collision course which will culminate, temporarily at least, at Lens' Stade Bollaert-Delelis on Sunday.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast"

        "content": "Parrott has scored five goals in 25 appearances for the Republic of Ireland\nAZ Alkmaar forward Troy Parrott says he has no regrets about his time with former club Tottenham as he prepares to face them in the Europa League last 16.\nThe 23-year-old had his pick of the top clubs as a 15-year-old with Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea all interested.\nHe decided his future was with Spurs, but it didn't work out for the Republic of Ireland international and he made just four senior appearances before being sent out on loan spells in the second and third tiers of English football.\nIn 2023, he sought a new challenge in the Dutch first division.\n\"For me it just didn't happen [with Spurs]. I'm OK with that,\" Parrott said.\n\"I look back with a smile. It's a place where I grew up. I moved away from home quite young, so when I went there I was in a phase of going from a kid to a teenager and then past that.\n\"It helped me become the person and player I am now, so I can only look back on that with good memories.\"\nParrott is now flourishing in the Dutch top-flight after Tottenham sold him to AZ Alkmaar in July 2024 for Â£6.7m following a season-long loan at Excelsior, who were relegated from the Eredivisie last season despite Parrott scoring 17 goals in 32 appearances.\nThis season he has featured in all 38 of AZ Alkmaar's matches in all competitions, starting 34 and coming on as a substitute in four with a tally of 17 goals.\n\"I'm here, I'm really enjoying myself here, I love life over here. Now I'm just focusing on where I am right now and trying to progress and keep getting better here,\" he said.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\nParrott has already been reunited with his former club once this season, with the two meeting in the Europa League group phase in October where Spurs won 1-0.\n\"I feel we're in a better position now than we were when we played the first time,\" Parrott said.\nThe striker struggled for opportunities during his stint at Spurs and many fans called on then-manager Jose Mourinho to hand him more minutes.\nBut the minutes did not come and in 2020 he moved to Millwall on loan before heading out to Ipswich, MK Dons, Preston and eventually Excelsior.\nHe has previously discussed his struggles with living up to \"the hype\" that followed him in his early career and said the media attention \"used to get to me a bit\".\nParrott is now thriving in the Netherlands and his goal scoring record speaks for itself.\n\"I want to score in every game and tomorrow is just another game to try to do that.

        "content": "The rise and fall of North Korea - the sleeping giant of women's football\n\"Normally when there are 30 shots in the game, it is the United States with about 25 of 'em. Not today!\"\nIt wasn't just the ESPN commentator who was shocked.\nHeather O'Reilly had scored the game's final goal, dragging world number ones and two-time champions United States to a 2-2 draw in their opening match at the 2007 Women's World Cup.\nO'Reilly wasn't surprised by the scoreline though. Or how evenly-fought the game was. She knew it would be tough.\nInstead, as the final whistle blew, it was the attitude of the US's opponents, who saw a chance missed, rather than a point gained, that struck her.\n\"I remember North Korea seeming disappointed,\" says O'Reilly.\n\"Their body language seemed to say 'oh my gosh, we were so close to taking down the giant'.\"\nNorth Korea is the world's most isolated country, a state based around the infallibility of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and a deep suspicion of the outside world.\nYet, despite living standards being well behind most other nations, North Korea has been one of the strongest female football nations on the planet.\nWhen they took on the United States in 2007, they were ranked fifth in the world and amid a run of three Asian titles in the space of a decade.\nTheir record at youth level is even better. In 2016, they won the U20 Women's World Cup, defeating Spain, the United States and France in the knockout rounds. That same year, their under-17 team also lifted their age-grade World Cup.\n\"The game in 2007 was challenging, really super hard,\" remembers O'Reilly of her meeting with North Korea's senior side. \"It was hard to get the ball off them, they were buzzing around, very quick.\"\nThere was another challenge though, one that was unique to North Korea.\n\"It was just such a cloud of uncertainty,\" says O'Reilly. \"The film we had on them was very limited, even by the standard of the times.\n\"Every time we played North Korea, it was always a mystery.\"\nThe mystery now is, after a doping controversy and a four-year absence from international football, can North Korea's women be a force once again?\nO'Reilly (centre) competes for the ball during the United States' 2-2 draw with North Korea at the 2007 Women's World cup\nO'Reilly and her United States team-mates may have lacked footage of North Korea. Brigitte Weich certainly doesn't.\nThe Austrian filmmaker spent five years following the North Korean team, gaining unprecedented access to its inner workings and players for her 2009 documentary Hana, dul, sed., external\nShe says that, like with most things in North Korea, the country's over-sized impact on the women's game is attributed to the man at the very top.\n\"The players constantly said to us that the Dear Leader Kim Jong-il [Kim Jong-un's predecessor] personally supported women's football,\" says Weich.\n\"Of course, they refer everything directly to the leader and nothing happens without him guiding, supporting or wanting it.\n\"But it is a very hierarchical and totalitarian dictatorship and I think that is kind of true.\"\nWeich (centre, in blue jacket) followed the North Korean team at the 2003 Asian Cup, the 2003 Women's World Cup and the qualification tournament for the 2004 Olympics\nWeich relays a theory that North Korea's focus on women's football sprung from a stage in Mexico in 1986.\nAt that year's Fifa congress, Norwegian Ellen Wille, only 4ft 11in tall, stepped up to the lectern and started her speech â the first by a woman at a Fifa Congress - with a scream of anger., external\nShe was infuriated by the sidelining of the women's game, which had been consigned to half a page in Fifa's weighty annual report.\nShe demanded a World Cup for women. Fifa, shell-shocked, agreed. And, the theory goes, the North Korean delegates in the room returned to Pyongyang with a plan.\n\"Maybe someone came to Kim Jong-il and said to him that we could use this,\" says Weich.\n\"North Korea is not the best in economics, science, human rights and the rest, but in countries like this they can be good at some sports because, from the top down, they can focus on training and nothing else.\n\"I don't think it is a total myth that Kim Jong-il had an interest in women's football, perhaps because he saw it as a chance to show up at a world level.\"\nNorth Korea celebrate a goal against Sweden at the 2007 Women's World Cup\nThe plan was simple, sweeping and efficient. Formal football training at school from an early age, scouts sent out across the country, and, for the best, a central school of excellence and a raft of army teams allowing them to train and develop full-time at the state's expense.\nThe material rewards for North Korea's players aren't big-money contracts or overseas moves. Instead relocation, rather than remuneration, is the lure.\nFor many in North Korea, life is unremittingly grim.\nShortages in food, healthcare and heating are common, particularly in rural areas.\nA United Nations report in 2023 detailed the forced labour and sexual violence that is common in detention centres, which citizens can be transferred to for various crimes against the state.\nSome of those who have escaped the country have recounted women prisoners undergoing forced abortions., external\nPyongyang presents differently. Living standards and leisure opportunities are better than in the provinces.\nHigh-rise appartment blocks, a 150,000-capacity stadium, bowling alleys, department stores, a zoo, and a fairground are part of a faded Soviet-era cityscape of concrete monumentalism.\n\"It seems to be a privilege to live in Pyongyang and not in the countryside,\" says Weich.\n\"The players received, as a gift from the leader, apartments in Pyongyang and could bring their parents to Pyongyang. Being picked for the team can be a career for a woman and her entire family - it can be life-changing.\"\nThe Kim family dynasty has ruled the country since its founding in 1948. Kim Jong-un, the grandson and son of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il respectively, has been in power since 2011\nIn the 2000s, when England's women would rarely attract crowds in five figures, North Korea were packing out the 50,000-capacity Kim Il-sung Stadium.\nWhether or not all the spectators attended willingly - crowds of military personnel or whole factory workforces have been used as the backdrop to state occasions - the players are high-profile figures.\n\"They are stars,\" says Weich. \"Fans know them, recognise them and ask them for autographs.\"\n\"There was even a soap opera based around the women's football team, with fictional troubles - parents opposing them playing or forbidden love affairs and so on.\"\nGetting on the national team also means players can get out of the country. North Koreans are not allowed to travel abroad without permission from the state.\nInternational tournaments and fixtures bring players into contact with realities unknown to many of their compatriots.\n\"The players I followed said 'the Americans are much taller than us and much stronger than us, because they have enough food and all kinds of things we don't have - but our minds are so strong, no-one expects that',\" remembers Weich.\n\"They all loved football, but the leader and the nation were big motivations.\n\"That is how they are brought up: the glory of the nation is everything and the individual is nothing.\"\nNorth Korea women warm up at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang before an 8-0 win over Taiwan in April 2007\nAt the 2007 Women's World Cup, after drawing with O'Reilly's United States, North Korea progressed from the group ahead of Sweden and Nigeria, before losing to eventual winners Germany in the quarter-finals.\n\"At that World Cup in 2007, we were staying at the same hotel as North Korea and I clearly remember having a moment when we were in the elevator with some of the North Korea players,\" says O'Reilly.\n\"I remember thinking it would be cool to try to talk or play cards or anything to have some kind of cultural breakthrough.\n\"But it was definitely a fleeting thought because it didn't appear that they wanted to engage much. Perhaps it was unfair of me to think, but there were not a tonne of smiles and eye contact being exchanged. They were all business in that elevator.\n\"But you have those thoughts about what is their training like, what is their preparation like, when did they get into the sport - I was always so curious about their backstories.\"\nTheir 2011 campaign was notable for different reasons - North Korea's women were caught up in football's biggest doping scandal in a generation.\nFive of their players tested positive for a rare kind of steroids. North Korea's explanation was even rarer.\nThey said that the positive tests were caused by a traditional medicine made from the glands of a musk deer., external Officials explained it had been administered to the players after lightning struck their training ground back in North Korea.\nWere North Korea's players powered by something more than patriotic fervour, a systemic focus on the female game and a sweat-soaked training regime?\nFive members of North Korea's 2011 Women's World Cup team tested positive for a rare kind of steroid, causing their expulsion from the next edition in 2015\nA suspicious Fifa banned them from the 2015 World Cup. With their qualification seeding dented by their suspension, North Korea failed to make the 2019 tournament. They were then absent from the 2023 tournament as well, after North Korea withdrew from the international scene under some of the toughest Covid restrictions in the world.\nLast autumn, on their return to action, North Korea won silver at the Asian Games. They narrowly missed out on a place at the Paris 2024 Olympics after a 2-1 aggregate defeat by Japan in a two-legged play-off in February.\nNo-one quite knows what sort of force the team will be able to muster in the future.\nCan a wealth of youth talent translate into senior strength? Or will the development of the women's game around the rest of the world, and North Korea's isolation from it, leave them with too much to make up? How much have the pandemic border closures forced the authorities to refocus on more essential needs of its people, amid reports of starvation?\nAs with most things about North Korea, from the broadest intentions to the smallest detail, it is a mystery.\nNorth Korea's women's team have featured in the regime's domestic propaganda\nInside the gym building champions - and community\nChasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning\nFuelling the Tour de France: Secrets of the team kitchens\nPanenka - the penalty that killed a career and started a feud\nRunning on a volcano's rim - the race in the shadow of an eruption"

        "content": "Newcastle United's Jacob Murphy celebrates opening the scoring in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Arsenal at St James' Park\nNewcastle United moved a giant step closer to ending a 56-year wait to win a major trophy as they secured a place in the Carabao Cup final with victory over Arsenal after an emotional night on Tyneside.\nEddie Howe's side, who held a 2-0 advantage from the semi-final first leg, completed the second part of the assignment, and will now face Liverpool or Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley as they stand one victory away from ending a sequence without major success stretching back to the 1969 triumph in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.\nNewcastle made a flying start, with Alexander Isak having a goal ruled out for offside before Jacob Murphy turned home a rebound in the 19th minute after the Sweden striker's shot hit the post.\nThe goal came seconds after Martin Odegaard missed what turned out to be Arsenal's best chance of turning this semi-final around, glancing the post with only keeper Martin Dubravka to beat.\nIn a tumultuous atmosphere, with the Toon Army urging their side on at deafening volume, Newcastle delivered the decisive blow after 52 minutes following a nightmare moment for Arsenal keeper David Raya.\nRaya inexplicably tried to find Declan Rice, who was shadowed by Fabian Schar. He stole possession away from Rice, leaving Anthony Gordon with a simple finish to send Newcastle back to Wembley.\nAnd the Geordie hordes will be hoping to make up for losing against Manchester United in the EFL Cup final two years ago, as well as claiming a first domestic honour since the 1955 FA Cup.\nNewcastle went into this second leg surrounded by nerves, despite holding that healthy 2-0 advantage in front of their own fanatical fanbase.\nThe unease was created by two home defeats against Bournemouth and Fulham, while Arsenal looked to be hitting their stride with a 5-1 thrashing of Premier League champions Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.\nThey were also without the influential Joelinton, ruled out by the knee injury he suffered in the weekend loss against Fulham. In the end, his power and threat was not missed.\nNewcastle needed a fast start, ideally accompanied by a goal, to sweep away the anxiety lingering in this thunderous environment. The dream opening duly arrived.\nAnd it was the talisman Isak who was the inspiration, running Arsenal ragged, as he did at Emirates Stadium, in those early stages, having a crisp finish disallowed for a marginal offside then being heavily involved in Murphy's opener.\nThe only question was whether Newcastle could keep up the breathtaking pace and intensity, but when the tempo did die down they were able to exert a measure of control that ensured they always remained in charge of the destiny of this semi-final.\nGordon's goal was the clincher, the catalyst for a long period of celebration as Newcastle moved towards a successful finale.\nAnd now the dream is within touching distance again for Newcastle and the supporters who crave success after that defeat against Manchester United at Wembley in 2023.\nVictory against either Liverpool or Spurs at Wembley would ensure legendary status for manager Howe and his players.\nNewcastle's jubilant, Wembley-bound fans waited until victory was assured before taunting Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta for comments made in the aftermath of the first leg.\nArteta complained that Arsenal had difficulties with the ball being used in the competition, although Newcastle's players did not appear to have any similar problems.\nAnd it came back to bite him as chants of \"Mikel Arteta It Must Be The Ball\", as the Gunners subsided tamely to defeat.\nArsenal and Arteta can have no complaints here, as they have been comprehensively outplayed by Newcastle over the two legs.\nThe big chance came and went with that early Odegaard chance, as once Murphy had stretched the aggregate lead to 3-0, there was no coming back.\nArsenal were unable to reach the levels that saw them demolish Manchester City on Sunday. There was no lack of effort, but inspiration was in short supply and once Newcastle got their second on the night the task was insurmountable.\nAn injury to winger Gabriel Martinelli did not help, but in reality Arsenal's attempt to rescue the situation they found themselves after the first leg fizzled out swiftly.\nThe Gunners performed in average fashion over both games, ended well beaten, and must now turn their attentions back to attempting to haul in Premier League leaders Liverpool and the Champions League.\nAfter the opportunity to rate players has closed, the score displayed represents the average from all the submissions by BBC Sport users."

We've had a lot of training time because Ed has been suspended, so although it's only two games they've trained a lot together.\"\nHe added: \"Out in La Manga we did a lot of work on their movement, and how we shift and how we want to defend, and we're seeing the benefits of that.\n\"But I think individually they are standing up to pressure. They are putting bodies on the line and that is the foundation of any good defender, so we're delighted to see that.\""

        "title": "Crowds of 273 to Champions League - rise of Europe's 'hottest property'",
        "content": "Nicky Hayen's Club Brugge beat Aston Villa in the Champions League group stage this season\nAt the time it felt like a surprise appointment for semi-professional Haverfordwest County of the Cymru Premier.\nThree years on, and with the manager who joined them on New Year's Eve 2021 leading his current side into a Champions League knockout tie against Aston Villa, it seems scarcely believable.\nNicky Hayen was the first Belgian to manage in the Welsh Premier League and remains one of only a handful of non-British or non-Irish managers to do so.\nThe 44-year-old's ascent to the latter stages of Europe's top-tier competition with Club Brugge, who knocked out Europa League holders Atalanta in the play-offs, has been as rapid as it has been impressive.\nNow he is being touted as one of Europe's \"hottest properties\", and one pundit even suggested Hayen could be Arne Slot's replacement at Liverpool.\nFew of the 273 present at Bridge Meadow Stadium when Hayen recorded the biggest home win of his Haverfordwest tenure - a 6-1 thumping of Cefn Druids - would have predicted their manager would be in such conversation only a few years later.\nBut for Haverfordwest chairman Rob Edwards, who remains close friends with Hayen and shares regular messages with him, it comes as no surprise.\n\"The guy was a workaholic,\" recalls Edwards, whose house Hayen shared while living in west Wales.\n\"I would wake up at 8am and he'd be dressed, watching clips of opposition, doing analysis. I'd go to bed at 11pm and he'd be up, watching clips and doing analysis.\"\nClub Brugge took the lead before losing 3-1 at Manchester City in January\nHayen, a former defender who played more than 400 games in Belgium and the Netherlands, reached Wales largely via coaching, technical director and caretaker manager roles in Belgium and Saudi Arabia.\nHis major managerial breakthrough at Waasland-Beveren ended in Covid-impacted relegation to the Belgian second tier.\nHe connected with Edwards via a mutual contact in Belgium and, backed by a Uefa Pro Licence and stellar presentation, wowed the board during the interview stage.\n\"We just wanted to listen to every word he said,\" explains Edwards, who took over the club in 2020 and made Hayen his first managerial appointment the following year.\n\"We decided he was the person we wanted and did all we could to get him. Fortunately, he turned up.\"\nThe experience and professionalism Hayen brought to the part-timers had an immediate impact, taking them from second-bottom to the verge of the European play-offs in fewer than six months, implementing a possession-based, passing approach rarely witnessed in the Welsh top flight.\n\"You could see by the impact he had on the players,\" says Edwards. \"He didn't try to over-coach them - just give them very detailed stats about the opposition, very detailed analysis.\n\"He spent his time getting to know the players. He was very methodical. He asked about their welfare; he was worried about the mental side of the game as well.\n\"He managed to get a really amazing standard out of players we probably didn't realise had it in them.\n\"For me, it was a massive learning curve working with someone at that level, but he was very calm. He wasn't a shouter in the dressing room - he spoke and you listened.\n\"Despite not being the loudest, most aggressive, he had an aura - you just wanted to listen to him.\"\nIt is to Hayen's credit that he slipped seamlessly into life in the Pembrokeshire market town, despite having to leave his family in Belgium.\n\"There are 14,000 people who live in Haverfordwest. It's a beautiful part of the world but a bit of a culture shock,\" says Edwards.\n\"He wasn't really too concerned about what was around him. He was focused on the football. He embraced the culture and didn't try to change anything drastically. But he was just obsessed with football.\n\"He is a family man, doesn't drink, doesn't use social media. He just gets his head down. He deserves everything he gets.\"\nClub Brugge have won five of their 10 Champions League games this season\nEdwards knew the day would come, but he was hoping the club would get a little longer with Hayen at the helm.\nWhen, in the summer of 2022, an approach arrived from Club Brugge to take over their Under-23s, Club NXT, it proved impossible for Hayen to turn down.\n\"It was a little bit of a surprise,\" says Edwards. \"I wasn't expecting to have any dialogue with a club like Club Brugge.\"\nHayen stepped in as first-team assistant after Scott Parker was sacked in 2023, before getting his chance as interim manager when Ronny Deila left last March.\nThere, Hayen found former Sint-Truiden team-mate and ex-Liverpool and Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to confide in.\n\"When [Deila] stepped down with 10 games to go last season, Nicky stepped in and won nine of them and they came out of nowhere to win the league. That was a real statement,\" says Edwards.\nIt was during that run that Jan Mulder, the former Ajax and Anderlecht striker turned pundit, made a prediction for Hayen's future.\n\"Next year [he] will play a series of matches in the Champions League, attracting the attention of Madrid, Barcelona, ââBayern and Manchester,\" Mulder wrote in Humo, external in May 2024.\n\"Nasser Al-Khelaifi of Paris St-Germain also joins the fight for his signature at the last minute. Personally, I think that the great Nicky Hayen will replace Arne Slot from Zwolle as manager of Liverpool within two years.\"\nThe first part of Mulder's premonition has proven to be true - Hayen's Brugge beat Villa, Sporting and Sturm Graz in the group phase, as well as drawing with Juventus and Celtic.\nThe Belgian champions followed up by defeating Atalanta in both legs of their play-off for a 5-2 aggregate victory.\nPrior to that second leg in Italy, Hayen explained how before games he always talks to his mother, who passed away four years ago.\n\"What he has achieved in the Champions League is just incredible. Club Brugge over the years have had far better sides on paper, but he is getting an incredible tune out of them,\" says Edwards.\n\"He is a workaholic, fanatical and leads from the front. I guess that is why a lot of these younger players who are coming through are working so hard for him and having great success.\"\nHayen's brief tenure in Wales also set the platform for Haverfordwest's future. In 2023, under Tony Pennock, they qualified for Europe for the first time in 19 years and only the second time in their history, reaching the Europa Conference League second qualifying round.\n\"It's great for the club to be associated with someone like that,\" says Edwards.\n\"It seems like it is only the start for him. I would love for him to go on. I am sure there will be opportunities to manage even higher if he carries on.\n\"He is probably one of the hottest properties in Europe.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast"

We have to go out there and absolutely die for the cause.\n\"I'll make sure that their levels are there next week - and I've not said that very often. It has just dropped off.\"\nShrewsbury face another huge game on Saturday when fellow relegation candidates Burton Albion come to The Croud Meadow.\nWith the two other sides currently in the bottom four - Crawley Town and Cambridge United - playing on Tuesday, victory could be even more vital for Shrewsbury at the weekend.\n\"We always knew it was tough,\" Ainsworth said.\n\"There has been an upturn. I need a big, big upturn now for these last 10 games because hopefully that's a sharp shock to some of them to say, 'look, this is what I expect'.\n\"They know I demand more. I expect more from them.\n\"There's 30 points to play for, so of course it [avoiding relegation] can be done.\""

        "title": "'Thank you Gareth - you gave a nation new memories'",
        "content": "BBC Sport's Kelly Somers has written an open letter to departing England manager Gareth Southgate, having reported on the national team since 2021.\nDear Gareth,\nIâm writing this as someone whoâs had the privilege of being in your company quite a lot for the past three years, so shall we start with an apology? Iâm sorry that winning and progressing in tournaments came with the caveat that meant you had to speak to me so much. But for what itâs worth, over the past three years they have given me some of my career highlights.\nFrom the moment I took over as BBC Sportâs England reporter in 2021, I knew it was an exciting time for football in the country - as another more experienced reporter told me, it hadnât always been like this, and somehow youâd taken what you started in Russia and bottled it up and kept it for that Euros. And what a time we - the media, the players, the fans - had. Iâll never forget after the Germany knockout win, as I asked you how it felt for you to beat them after what happened in 1996, and you looked at the big screen and said youâd seen an image of your former team-mate David Seaman during the game and knew you could never repay him and your team-mates for your missed penalty, but you wanted to give people new memories. And that you did.\nBut this isnât just the moments on the pitch or on camera - for which there were many - it was the moments off it too that will stay with me. Every interview we did, without fail, you walked in, said hello and shook every crew memberâs hand. You asked how we were - and it didnât feel just routine. It felt real. I can imagine at times that the job of England manager doesnât make you feel very human, but you always did.\nWhen I returned to St Georgeâs Park last September for the first time since Iâd announced my pregnancy, you arrived with a gift for my baby. But you didnât really want to take the credit, ensuring your colleagues in the media team who had organised it did. Iâll almost remember that more than the gesture - and you asking after my family when I saw you after. Because football mattered, but you knew that people, and family, matter more.\nSouthgate resigns after England's Euro 2024 loss\n'Southgate deserves respect but was not the winner England wanted'\nWho will be next England manager?\nBut reporter and manager relationships canât always be pleasantries and presents. At times I have to ask the difficult questions, and you always respected that. After the game against Denmark in the group stage, I asked you if the team dropping off after scoring was an instruction from you, if Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield was working and if England were playing well enough overall. You answered them all with the same level of detail as you always did - and still walked in with the same smile and handshake before our next interview just two days later. We both had a job to do, and you knew that.\nThat said, this tournament did feel like it had taken its toll. While the smiles and handshakes never stopped, there were times when you walked in I felt the weight of expectation on your shoulders, as well as the desperation to succeed. The mood did lift after Switzerland - the post-match celebrations with the fans perhaps went some way in reassuring you there was still belief in you and your plan, but it was clearly too little, too late.\nâWhat happens on Sunday will define me to others but not to myself,â was your message in our final sit-down interview - and it was clear now, you already knew that youâd gone as far as you could as England manager. I donât believe there is anyone that would have wanted to lift that trophy more on Sunday, or in 2018, 2021 or 2022. And I donât believe there is anyone who dealt with you regularly, as we did, that didnât want you to end with that either.\nSo thank you Gareth, for giving this reporter, who grew up watching England teams rarely go deep into tournaments, the opportunity to have a front-row seat when they did. And when they do eventually lift that trophy, I hope you still get satisfaction in knowing that you have laid the foundations for that success.\nBut for now, as you also said to me in an interview in Germany - whatever happened out there, your dog will still greet you the same way regardless when you walk back through the door. So enjoy those dog walks Gareth, youâve earned them.\nKelly."

        "title": "Why did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?",
        "content": "Fans had to wait eight minutes for the VAR officials to disallow a Bournemouth goal\nThe Football Association has said the record eight-minute VAR stoppage during Bournemouth's FA Cup fifth-round win against Wolves was caused by a congested penalty area.\nIt came during the first weekend of the semi-automated offside system being trialled in English football, which is supposed to reduce the decision time by 30 seconds in close offside calls.\nThe officials were unable to rely on that technology during the check, and needed to revert to manually drawn lines before disallowing Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez's 35th-minute goal.\nFellow defender Dean Huijsen was adjudged to have been in an offside position as Kerkez's effort brushed his shoulder.\nBut the stoppage was also extended as the video assistant referee (VAR) pairing Timothy Wood and Darren England made two different checks for handball - including against Huijsen - prior to the tight offside call.\nWolves supporters did not celebrate the decision that benefited their team, and allied with the home supporters by chanting \"it's not football any more\" and \"this is embarrassing\" during the unprecedented stoppage.\nDuring the break in play, referee Sam Barrott explained what was happening to the managers and players, while some on the pitch opted to re-do their warm-up routines.\nThe previous longest VAR check was believed to be five minutes 37 seconds in the Premier League match between West Ham and Aston Villa in March 2024.\nThe FA's explainer of semi-automated offsides said: \"Most offside decisions will be quicker, but VAR will still have the option to draw crosshairs as a back-up if required.\n\"This process may be necessary in 'edge cases' where several players block the view of the ball or other players for the system's cameras. This may occasionally result in the length of check we have seen previously in specific scenarios with VAR checking close offsides.\n\"The length of certain VAR checks may also remain where decisions need to consider multiple offside checks or other offenses such as fouls or handballs in the attacking possession phase.\"\nEx-Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on BBC Match of the Day: \"Clear and obvious? Not at all.\n\"It's outrageous how long it has taken - ridiculous. It's just not on at all.\"\nSemi-automated offsides were meant to have been introduced in the Premier League last year, but that was delayed.\nFriday's FA Cup game between Aston Villa and Cardiff was the first time it was used in English football - and that passed without problem.\nIt is only being used in seven of the eight FA Cup fifth-round ties, because Championship club Preston do not have the correct technology.\nThe Premier League said this week: \"Following successful live operation in the FA Cup, the Premier League will look to implement the system later this season.\"\nSemi-automated offsides are already used in the Champions League, La Liga and Serie A - and were used in the 2022 World Cup.\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhat are semi-automated offsides, and how do they work?\nEach Premier League ground has had up to 30 new cameras installed, capturing footage at 100 frames per second, twice as fast as regular broadcast cameras.\nThe cameras track the ball as well as up to 10,000 points on each player - meaning it should see if they were involved earlier in the move too.\nThe semi-automated offside technology suggests the point at which the ball was kicked and draws offside lines on the second-nearest player on the defending team - as well as the attacking player in question.\nIt still has to be reviewed by the VAR afterwards to make sure it did not make an effort with the 'kick point' or the parts of the body used for the lines.\nOfficials would still need to decide whether a player who did not touch the ball was interfering with play, or if a defender's touch needs to be factored in.\nBournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said: \"Today I was very, very disappointed with the referees. Not just today, but also in the last weeks, because every time we have something happening. Today it was the automated offside not working.\n\"They told us that they would implement it after the first or second international break. But something has obviously not gone right as it has come later in the season.\n\"They checked offside. The semi-automated offside was not working so they checked it manually. It was a lengthy, lengthy wait.\"\nOn the introduction of the new system, Iraola told BBC's Match of the Day: \"We continued pushing and today we have semi-automatic offside.\n\"It has cost us 30 games to put it [in]. In the first game we need it, it goes against us.\n\"It doesn't work. They had to draw the lines - seven minutes there waiting. It is definitely not a good sign for everyone involved.\"\nWolves manager Vitor Pereira said: \"It was some problem in the machine. I don't know what happened, but in the end I understand.\n\"Before, we celebrated the goals, but now it is difficult to celebrate the goals. You must wait and wait and wait to understand if it is a goal or not.\n\"Football is fairer now because, before, a lot of goals were offside and you saw a lot of goals happen without correct decisions.\"\nAdditional reporting by Emlyn Begley\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

        "title": "Celtic's 'physical beast' Maeda makes mark yet again",
        "content": "This video can not be played\nDaizen Maeda pounces to give Celtic lead over Hibs\nA quick scan of Celtic forward Daizen Maeda's social media accounts tells you two things about him. He loves football. And he loves his family. That's it.\nHis endearingly short interviews in English, and even his native Japanese, give the impression he is a quiet, understated man.\nThose who know the 27-year-old best might say differently, but to the outside world that's how it seems.\nHis compatriot Kyogo Furuhashi often took the headlines at Celtic, before his January departure for Rennes, due his knack of scoring big goals, and lots of them.\nBut coaches have described Maeda as a \"machine\" and a \"physical beast\" for his seemingly unlimited stamina, and now he is having the best season of his Celtic career, scoring 27 goals so far and 13 in his last 13 games.\nFive of those have come in the Scottish Cup, with the latest in Sunday's quarter-final win over Hibernian.\n\"That goal just sums up his whole season,\" said former Celtic midfielder John Collins on Sportsound. \"He's electric, off the mark, hungry in and around the six-yard box.\"\nMaeda & Idah help Celtic past Hibs in cup\nLatest news, analysis & fan views\nAfter Celtic opened their Champions League campaign with a thumping 5-1 win against Slovan Bratislava, manager Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on Maeda.\nFormer Celtic and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart had used a clip of the 27-year-old thwarting a Slovan counter-attack on BBC Sport's Champions League highlights programme.\nMaeda hounded Slovan's right-back and centre-back, winning possession.\nRodgers cited that moment and said he doubted \"there's anyone better in world football\" at setting the tone from the front.\nThere are numerous examples of the Celtic forward doing just that.\nIn the League Cup final this season, he ran down Rangers defender Leon Balogun, stole the ball and ran through to score.\nStrangely, the moment which sums up his attitude and speed came near the end of a 6-0 drubbing of St Johnstone in September, when Celtic lost the ball in the final third and he sprinted the length of the pitch to win it back with the game long won.\nAt the time, Rodgers applauded it on the touchline as much as any goal.\nThis video can not be played\nHis former coach at Yokohama F Marinos John Hutchinson knew exactly what was coming when Ange Postecoglou recruited him from his old club.\n\"I have never seen a more physical player, in terms of speed and repeat sprinting, than Daizen,\" he said in 2022, external.\n\"Daizen is a physical beast. You'd have no issues sending him anywhere in Europe because it won't be a problem to him. He's a machine.\"\nRodgers was equally complimentary after yet another critical contribution, one which drew the danger from a potentially tricky cup tie with an in-form Hibs.\n\"Daizen is so honest. His anticipation and the ground he makes up... he's an amazing role model for young players with his work and his intensity,\" the manager said.\n\"He frightens opponents and they can't relax against him. With confidence has come calmness when it comes to finishing. He's not a traditional target man but he's a goalscorer.\"\nMaeda's close-range effort against Hibs took his tally to 24 in 41 games this term, his most productive in Scotland to date.\nNot bad for a player who played out wide for much of the season until Kyogo left.\nFour of those goals have come in the Champions League, including a brilliant curling effort to snatch a critical point against Club Brugge and one to give Celtic a chance in the second leg at Bayern Munich.\nFinishing was always a criticism of Maeda. Not that he lacked the ability to score good goals, but that he was guilty of some glaring misses.\nBut this season his shot conversion rate has gone up significantly, and his strikes have come in all different forms.\n\"Not only is he working really hard and using his energy and pace - but it looks as though any chance that comes to him he could put it in the back of the net,\" former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.\nIt was perhaps with that in mind that Rodgers has often opted to play Maeda through the middle in 2025 in preference to Adam Idah.\nAnd the Irish striker, who came on himself to score the late second against Hibs, was unsparing in his praise of his team-mate.\n\"I don't know how many games that is in a row that he's scored,\" he told Premier Sports.\n\"It's not just his goals, his performance on the pitch is amazing. He's the first name on the teamsheet, I don't know where we'd be without him.\"\nAfter his kick out late on against Young Boys earned him a red card in Celtic's penultimate Champions League group match, Maeda apologised to fans.\n\"I'm really sorry for causing trouble to the team in such a wonderful atmosphere,\" he posted on X.\nThere were plenty of responses which were along the lines of: 'Do whatever you like, pal,' which suggests how plenty feel about him and his performances.\nLikewise, rare glimpses of him away from playing endear him to supporters and are making him a much-loved figure.\nWhether it was having his young children as mascots, or recent cameo appearances in interviews alongside team-mates.\nEven ditching his previous routine of shaving his head before matches to grow his hair - apparently to appease his daughter who said she did not like him being bald - has added to the hero status.\nMaeda is now front and centre at Celtic and again proved the difference on Sunday.\nA version of this piece first appeared in February"

        "title": "'People go to the stadium for him' - why Bayern had to keep Musiala",
        "content": "Jamal Musiala has signed a new contract that will keep him at Bayern Munich until at least 2030\n\"People go to the stadium because of Jamal Musiala. He is an extraordinary player. Sometimes, you have the feeling gravity doesn't apply to him.\"\nThat was the praise for the 21-year-old from Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer as the club announced Musiala had extended his contract until 2030.\nIt must be a huge relief for the record German champions because he was close to entering the final year of his existing deal.\nAnything other than an extension might have put Bayern in an incredibly tough spot with Premier League and La Liga clubs keen.\nWhile sources close to the club had indicated negotiations between Bayern and Musiala's representatives were going well at the end of last year, it still took a while before a final agreement was reached.\nBased on his new contract, Musiala will earn Â£20.8m per year, making him one of the top earners at Bayern, alongside England captain Harry Kane.\nThe Musiala-Kane partnership is also an important element of the team's play that has secured them a comfortable lead in the Bundesliga - they are currently eight points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who they visit at the BayArena on Saturday.\nFriday's announcement might very well lift Bayern's spirits even higher going into the top-of-the-table encounter. Manager Vincent Kompany and director of sport Max Eberl are determined to build the squad around Musiala, a Chelsea academy graduate who joined Bayern in 2019.\nEven though he was not as well known to the wider public at the time of his move from England, Bayern were hoping they had secured a rare diamond at the time.\nAnd they certainly did. Within a few years, the Stuttgart-born Musiala rose from a promising midfielder to one of Europe's best playmakers.\nEven though he featured for England's youth national teams until November 2020, he eventually decided to play for Germany, establishing himself as the kingpin of Die Mannschaft alongside Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz.\nMusiala extends Bayern Munich contract until 2030\nMusiala, 21, has already won the Bundesliga four times\nWhile the negotiations between both parties were tough in recent months, Musiala did not enter transfer talks with any other clubs, indicating that he intended to stay with the 33-time German champions.\nBut as things go in modern football, he still wanted to receive a significant pay raise and a release clause, which was granted. The release clause can be triggered for Â£145m before the final year of his contract and then goes down to Â£83m.\nJust last week, it was revealed Kane also possesses certain release clauses that can be triggered before the respective ends of the January transfer windows to initiate a move for the summer.\nAs valuable as the England captain has been in his role as Bayern's top-notch goalscorer, the 31-year-old is obviously not seen as a long-term solution for Bayern, with an eventual return to the Premier League - where Kane could eventually break Alan Shearer's goalscoring record - appearing likely.\nMeanwhile, Musiala is 10 years younger than Kane and the perfect representative for Bayern, who have always been anxious to assemble the best German players, mixed with a number of high-profile talents from abroad.\nMusiala has already created countless moments of magic for Bayern, including his championship-clinching goal against Cologne in May 2023, when the team snatched the Bundesliga title from Borussia Dortmund during the final minutes of the season.\nMusiala played for England's youth teams but opted to represent Germany, the country of his birth\nWhen Musiala misses games or can only play a limited number of minutes due to an injury, his absence has been felt as the team does not look the same at all.\nBayern's 4-1 loss to Barcelona in the Uefa Champions League earlier this season was a prime example.\nMusiala himself has talked about how he can be almost obsessed with improving his game through repetition and specialised training, for example practising certain shooting positions and movements.\n\"I just try to do everything that can take me to the next level,\" he said in 2023. \"And I want to improve season after season and look at the little things which can take me further.\n\"I try to start at a young age with nutrition, the extra work so I can have more stamina, and then season by season, hopefully I get better.\"\nThere can be no doubt he has improved, instead of just resting on his natural talent as a footballer, and can do even further to put his name high among the world's best players in the future.\nIt is the reason why Musiala has just signed the most lucrative contract extension in German Bundesliga history.\nCeltic take German lessons to avert 'absolute thumping'"

        "content": "The Clarets are on a run of 12 consecutive clean sheets in the Championship\nSince Burnley last conceded a league goal, eight Championship clubs have changed managers, Manchester United have conceded 18 Premier League goals and the US has a new President.\nThe Clarets haven't been breached in the Championship since the 80th minute of a 2-1 win over Watford on 21 December. The promotion-chasing club's 4-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday on Friday was the team's 12th consecutive clean sheet in the league and left them third in the table.\nIn the entire history of the Football League since 1888, only one side has had a longer run of league games without conceding in the top four tiers, with Manchester United going 14 in a row during the 2008-09 season.\nThat record is now in sight for Scott Parker's team, who are unbeaten across their past 21 league games (W12 D9), the club's longest run since a 22-match run between November 2022 and April 2023.\nAcross 34 league games so far this season, the Clarets have conceded only nine goals and the 24 clean sheets kept so far by goalkeeper James Trafford equals the Championship's best by Wolves' John Ruddy and QPR's Paddy Kenny. They haven't conceded a single goal in any competition since beating Reading 3-1 in the FA Cup on 11 January.\nIt is a far cry from the team who were sometimes accused of being naive as they shipped 78 goals in the Premier League last season.\nFor any Championship managers hoping to end Burnley's record, stats from Opta show that six of the nine goals they have conceded have come from open play, with only two coming from crosses. They are also more vulnerable in the first half, with six of their nine goals conceded coming before the break.\nBBC Sport pulled together a list of six things that have happened since Burnley last shipped a league goal.\nThirty-five miles down the M66, Premier League giants Manchester United have conceded 18 Premier League goals and 21 goals in all competitions since 21 December, under new manager Ruben Amorim.\nThat won't make happy reading for fans of the club who were impermeable for 14 straight matches in 2008-09, when Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic marshalled the back line.\nWest Bromwich Albion, Stoke City, Millwall, Plymouth Argyle, Luton Town, Derby County, Blackburn Rovers and Swansea City have all seen managers depart since Burnley last leaked a goal.\nOf those clubs, six have made permanent appointments - West Brom re-appointed Tony Mowbray, Stoke hired Mark Robins, Alex Neil became Millwall manager, Plymouth appointed Miron Muslic, Matt Bloomfield was named Luton boss and Derby County brought in John Eustace from Blackburn.\nSwansea City are being led by interim coach Alan Sheehan, while David Lowe is in interim charge at Blackburn. The Lancashire club have received over 100 expressions of interest in the post since Eustace departed on 13 February.\nPremier League clubs spent around Â£370m in the winter transfer window, significantly up on the Â£100m paid out last year, with Manchester City spending almost as much as the other 19 top-flight teams combined.\nThe Clarets went into the market to recruit two new forwards on deadline day - Sporting's Marcus Edwards on loan and Ajax's Jaydon Banel for an undisclosed fee. Despite their imperious form in defence, Burnley have been blunt at the other end of the pitch at times this season, playing in 11 goalless draws.\nIn the time since Burnley goalkeeper Trafford's net last bulged in the league, the US have a new President and the world order has shifted. Since he was inaugurated for a second time on 20 January, President Donald Trump has signed over 70 executive orders, external.\nThose orders include tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada, pauses on foreign aid and an order ending efforts to replace plastic straws with paper alternatives.\nDuring a packed Christmas schedule of football, millions tuned in to watch the conclusion of Nessa and Smithy's 'will they, won't they?' romance in the Gavin & Stacey finale. According to official Barb ratings figures, after seven days of catch-up viewing the Christmas Day episode of the much-loved comedy had been watched by 19.11 million people, making it one of the most-watched scripted TV shows of the century.\nAmong all the changes in the world since Burnley last conceded, some things have remained constant. Wales are still waiting for their first victory in international rugby since the World Cup in October 2023.\nDefeat by Ireland on Saturday meant their record of international losses stretches to 15 games. However, the spirited manner in which they fought against the holding Six Nations champions under new interim coach Matt Sherratt will inspire hope that the unwanted run of losses may be broken soon - perhaps even before Burnley concede next.\nHow Kompany is 'paving way' for black coaches at Bayern\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

We are really hopeful that we'll be able to see him on the pitch soon.\n\"If he can, he's just got that little bit of quality in and around the goal to create and score so that could be a real plus for us.\"\nWith 12 games left, Cowley said he was happy for his side to be \"under the radar\" going into Saturday's away game against Cheltenham Town.\nCowley also played down concerns about the state of their own pitch at the JobServe Community Stadium.\nThe playing surface currently lacks grass in areas while drainage issues have been a concern for several years, to the point the club had to reduce the size of the pitch last term to try and get around them.\nSpeaking earlier in the week, Cowley told BBC Essex: \"The pitch is incredibly difficult, probably the most difficult that I've had to prepare a team for.\n\"But it's our pitch, and a pitch we are finding good form on, and we are really enjoying playing here.\"\nStriker Lyle Taylor has contributed 12 goals in all competitions this season and said the team were currently \"doing our job - no more, no less\".\n\"If nobody else is watching us, that's fine by us,\" Taylor said. \"I don't think any noise from outside our four walls, or our four stands, really matters.\n\"The road to success is not a straight line, so we have to keep doing what we've done to get to this point - and do more, and better than we've done.\""

        "title": "Are top-flight battlers Luton 'resigned to another relegation'?",
        "content": "Former Wigan Athletic midfielder Thelo Aasgaard was one of the players brought in by Luton during the January transfer window\nThere is no escaping the fact that for Luton Town time is rapidly running out.\nIt is just 21 months since the euphoric scenes to celebrate the club's promotion to the Premier League under Rob Edwards.\nBut he was unable to keep them there and the team, now with Matt Bloomfield in charge, are facing the very real possibility of finding themselves back in League One at the start of next season.\nSunday's 2-0 derby defeat by Watford left Luton stuck at the bottom of the Championship, five points from safety, and with only 12 games remaining to save themselves from a second successive relegation.\nThey have not won for 12 league games and have taken just one point from their past 14 away from home - a run which which included 11 successive defeats.\nSo is there any hope for the Hatters?\nOn 30 January 2024, Luton beat Brighton & Hove Albion 4-0 with the help of a hat-trick from Elijah Adebayo and climbed out of the Premier League relegation places.\nIt was their biggest top-flight win since beating Southampton 6-1 in January 1989, and Edwards afterwards told BBC Match Of The Day: \"I feel - we feel - the best way for us to go in this league is to attack.\n\"We have to keep our foot down. We can't afford to stop because we're not good enough to do that.\"\nSadly Luton were unable to turn Edwards' words into deeds and they only won one of the 17 games that followed - a 2-1 home victory over Bournemouth - and finished 18th to slip back into the second tier.\nHe was upbeat last summer about their chances of bouncing back at the first attempt, but they only took one point from the first four games of the current campaign and it has been an uphill struggle since then.\nEdwards eventually left on 9 January following four defeats in a row, which left them two places above the bottom three.\nAnd the choice of his successor was obviously going to be a crucial one for chief executive Gary Sweet and the board.\nWatford ease to win over relegation-threatened Luton\nWhat went wrong for Edwards at Luton?\nMatt Bloomfield would like to be playing against former club Wycombe Wanderers in the Championship next season\nThey eventually settled on Bloomfield, who agreed a three-and-half-year contract, having only begun his managerial career in September 2022 at Colchester United.\nIt was his record at Wycombe Wanderers, though, which caught the eye of Luton, having guided the Chairboys into an automatic promotion spot in League One, going toe-to-toe with higher-profile rivals Birmingham City and Wrexham.\nSince his arrival, fresh blood has been brought in to rejuvenate the squad, but eight games later, he is still waiting for his first Luton victory.\nAnd now some fans are questioning whether he had the experience for this situation without having previously managed above the third tier.\n\"Bloomfield was a mistake,\" said supporter Ceiron in a message to BBC Sport. \"We have money. Priority should have been getting someone proven in to keep us in the Championship and look towards a rebuild over summer.\"\nThe Cornish Hatter added: \"Such a poor appointment with Bloomfield (clearly out of his depth) and the way we're playing we will even struggle in League One next season. If they ever finish Power Court it could be the best ground in League Two.\"\nMeanwhile, Chris messaged BBC Three Counties Radio to say: \"January signings, all youngsters, no experience brought in. I think Bloomfield is wishing he'd stayed at Wycombe.\"\nThis video can not be played\nLuton fans react to defeat by Watford\nEddie told BBC Three Counties Radio: \"I just despair with this team, a non-league team could beat us. The club should hang their heads in shame, I can never remember a worse team. A supporter since 1982, we've had worse individuals, but as a team, they're the worst.\"\nAnd Clive said: \"Totally predictable result (against Watford) for the Hatters today, given current form and league position. There is so little quality in our squad, it's hard to believe a year ago we were a Premier League side... the last 12 months have been disastrous.\"\nBut Richard did not blame Bloomfield for continuing poor performances, posting during the game: \"When will fans and pundits realise that changing the manager doesn't mean an improved team? Just look at Stoke (three managers this season already) and Manchester United.\n\"You have to accept that the players aren't good enough whoever is manager. I've already accepted it's League One next season.\"\nBBC Radio 5 Live reporter Aaron Paul, who covered the defeat at Watford, said Luton had been \"woeful\" in the first half and overall had \"not been good enough in every department\".\n\"This is a performance from a Luton team that looks like it is resigned to another relegation,\" he said at half-time. \"They look like they feel sorry for themselves.\"\nBut that was very much not the view of forward Carlton Morris following the game.\n\"We're in a difficult moment, there's no disputing that, but it's not how many times you get beaten down,  it's how you get up and react as a football club and as a human being,\" he told BBC Three Counties Radio.\n\"We have to score when we're on top and in the ascendancy, and be more diligent defensively.\n\"The game's won in both boxes, irrelevant of the overall performance - the best you can do is balance the game in your favour, but in the games we're doing that, we're losing because we've not been good enough in both boxes.\n\"We need to get that ruthless edge back.\"\nLuton's next away game is against Burnley, who won 4-1 at Kenilworth Road in August despite Tahith Chong's goal for the Hatters\nThe statistics are a clear indicator of why Luton are in their current plight.\nThey have only scored 31 goals in 34 games, two fewer than any other side in the Championship, and have let in 55 - one of only five teams to reach the half century.\nLuton have also lost 20 league games this season - more than any other Championship club - and 32 in 51 league matches in just under 13 months since that victory over Brighton.\nAnd they have won just one league game away from home since beating Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on 26 December 2023.\nWhen Edwards left Kenilworth Road, the Hatters were averaging 0.96 points per game this season - since then, that figure has declined to 0.82.\nOn that basis, they will only reach around 38 points by the end of the season which will certainly not be good enough to save them from the drop.\nOver the past 10 seasons, Reading's total of 41 points is the lowest among the teams who have finished in 21st place, just above the drop zone, and last  year Plymouth Argyle needed 51 to stay up.\nBloomfield conceded his side face an uphill task to survive.\n\"It is but it's one we believe we can achieve,\" he told BBC Three Counties Radio.\n\"We understand the situation. It's not where we want to be but the only way to get out of it is to stick together and keep fighting.\"\nOf their 12 remaining matches, Luton have five against teams no higher than 17th in the table - but unfortunately for them, given their record, four of them are away from home, against Cardiff City, Hull City, Stoke City and Derby County.\nIt means their home game against Portsmouth - currently 17th - is surely a must-win, given that they then travel to Burnley, the side with the most miserly defence in the English professional football, with just nine goals conceded in 34 games.\nThey also have a home fixture against Middlesbrough next month, but the first visitors to Kenilworth Road in April will be current leaders Leeds United, who have only lost three games.\nBurnley and Leeds not withstanding, Bloomfield's men need a healthy points tally up to and including the game at 23rd-placed Derby on 18 April.\nAfter that, they will meet Bristol City and Coventry City at home before finishing off away to West Bromwich Albion on 2 May, all three of those sides currently in or around the play-off places.\nLooks like staying up could be a tough ask.\nLatest Luton news, analysis and fan views\nGet Luton news sent straight to your phone"

        "title": "Who was the team of Euro 2024? The computer says...",
        "content": "Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams starred for Spain at Euro 2024\nIt was another case of so close yet so far for England, but few can argue that Spain were the worthy winners of Euro 2024.\nUsing the Opta index - which grades players across a wide pool of metrics - the sports analytics company have formulated a team of the tournament using data to support the selections.\nTheir picks have come from a plethora of extra insights from a database that contains every touch made at Euro 2024.\nA âbest XIâ will, of course, never manage to reach consensus among the mass of football opinion, but hereâs a data-led interpretation to test your fancyâ¦\nGiorgi Mamardashvili (Georgia)\nGeorgia managed to qualify for the knockout stages in what was their first ever major tournament and they owed plenty of thanks to their goalkeeper for that fact.\nMamardashvili's 21 saves were the joint-most ever by a goalkeeper in a group stage at the European Championship, along with Alexanders Kolinko in 2004.\nIndeed, based on the quality of shots on target faced using expected goals (xG), the Georgian prevented more goals than any other goalkeeper at Euro 2024 (+4.7 â eight goals conceded from 12.7 xG on target faced).\nJoshua Kimmich (Germany)\nKimmich was one of only two German outfielders, along with Antonio Rudiger, to play every minute for his side at Euro 2024. Indeed, he was a staple of the side in both presence and contribution, particularly on the attacking end.\nThe German right-back led all players for passes that broke that oppositionâs defensive line (17), and only Lamine Yamal (16) created more chances from open play than the Bayern Munich man (15).\nManuel Akanji (Switzerland)\nThough the Manchester City defenderâs tournament ended in penalty shootout heartbreak against England, Akanji had a fine campaign in general play, helping a sturdy Swiss side to the cusp of the semi-finals.\nAkanji was a fixture at the heart of Switzerlandâs defence, while they were the team who trailed on the scoreboard for the lowest percentage of their match time at Euro 2024 (2.5% - only behind for 13 minutes).\nMarc Guehi (England)\nIn what was his first ever appearance at a major international tournament, Guehi showed himself to be one of the most reliable defenders at Euro 2024. Indeed, the Crystal Palace man was one of the best developments throughout the tournament for England, and looks set to be a key part of their plans going forward.\nAppearing in all but one of his teamâs seven games in the competition, no England player won more aerial duels (12) than the defender, while he also led the team for blocks (6).\nMarc Cucurella (Spain)\nLeft-back Cucurella had been one of the question marks for Spain heading into Euro 2024, but he proved many doubters wrong by the end of it. Competitive in his defending and a contributor going forward, the Chelsea man did a fine job in taking up Jordi Albaâs mantle from previous editions.\nAs well as assisting the winning goal for Mikel Oyarzabal in the final, Cucurella had the most combined tackles and interceptions for Spain (20) across the tournament.\nToni Kroos (Germany)\nKroos didnât get the send-off his career would have otherwise merited (at least not internationally), but there was little doubt he went out on top in terms of his individual performance.\nKroos was the distribution master of Euro 2024 and went on to break the record (since 1980) for most completed passes in a single group stage in the competition (324).\nNot content merely to play from side-to-side, however, the German midfielder also led all players in the tournament for line-breaking passes (141) by a significant margin.\nFabian Ruiz (Spain)\nAnother tournament, another Spanish midfielder to remember. Following in the long line of crafty manipulators, Ruiz put together a superbly complete tournament at the heart of Spainâs midfield.\nAlong with being directly involved in four goals at Euro 2024 (two goals, two assists), he recovered possession more times overall (46) and in the final third (14) than any other player.\nThis video can not be played\n'Fearless & magical' Yamal is 'already world class'\nLamine Yamal (Spain):\nThe youngest player to ever appear in a World Cup or European Championship final (aged 17), Yamal wasnât content just to be in the showpiece. A trademark weaving run and composure to find the pass helped break the deadlock for Spain, as he assisted Nico Williamsâ opener on the night.\nYamal was directly involved in five goals overall at Euro 2024 (one goal, four assists), a joint-high alongside teammate Daniel Olmo. Indeed, his four assists were also the joint-most on record (since 1980) at a single edition of the European Championship.\nDani Olmo (Spain)\nOlmo may have started the tournament on the bench for Spain, but he ended it as one of the most influential players at Euro 2024. With his vibrant and direct style from the number 10 role, Spainâs already-dynamic attack got a lot harder to handle once Olmo came along.\nThe Leipzig man produced the joint-most goal involvements in the tournament (five â three goals, two assists), while his 14 completed dribbles were the most by a Spain player in a single edition of the European Championship since Lobo Carrasco in 1984 (16).\nThis video can not be played\nWilliams opens the scoring for Spain\nNico Williams (Spain)\nThe other half of Spainâs dynamic wing duo, Williams was another of the breakout stars to announce himself on the world stage at Euro 2024. In fact, when we look back on this tournament in the years and decades to come, many will remember this Spain team for the productivity of the wingers above all.\nIn opening the scoring in the showpiece against England, Williams (22y 2d) became the youngest player to score in a European Championship final since 1968, when a 20-year-old Italian Pietro Anastasi did so versus Yugoslavia.\nCody Gakpo (Netherlands)\nIf you thought Gakpoâs performance at the 2022 World Cup was a flash in the pan, then Euro 2024 will have made you think again. The Liverpool man has scored six goals in 11 games across the two tournaments, with Kylian Mbappe (9) the only European player to net more\nGakpo also scored and assisted in the Netherlandsâ win in the round of 16, becoming the first Dutch player to do so in a knockout stage game at the European Championship since Frank Rijkaard in the 1992 semi-final.\nEuro 2024 latest news and updates\nEuro 2024 fixtures and scores\nEuro 2024 groups\nEuro 2024 highlights\nWatch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast"

        "content": "Architecture group Foster + Partners has released some concept images of the proposed new stadium\nManchester United have announced ambitious plans to build a new Â£2bn 100,000-capacity stadium close to their current home at Old Trafford.\nRed Devils co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted to build the \"world's greatest football stadium\".\nBut when? And how can they afford it? What does it look like? And what happens to the current stadium?\nBBC Sport looks at some of the key questions surrounding the project.\nKey questions, images & reaction to Man Utd's new Â£2bn stadium\nMan Utd plan to build 'iconic' Â£2bn 100,000-capacity stadium\nThe Football News Show: Manchester United unveil new stadium plans\nManchester United believe the new stadium can be completed in five years.\nA project of this size would normally take about 10 years to complete.\nHowever, the club think they can halve the building time by making full use of the Manchester ship canal.\n\"Normally, if you were building a 100,000-seater stadium from the ground up, in an area that needs to be regenerated, it's a 10-year project. But if we get going with the government then I think it's a five-year project, not a 10-year project,\" said Ratcliffe.\nThe club plan to build large parts of the stadium off-site before shipping it to the Old Trafford site via the Manchester ship canal.\n\"It will be a modular build - that means it can be built far more quickly,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"There are yards which specialise in building very large structures, which are then shipped to locations around the world.\"\nArchitect Norman Foster added: \"Normally a stadium would take 10 years to build, we halved that time - five years. How do we do that? By pre-fabrication, by using the network of Manchester ship canal, bring it back to a new life, shipping in components, 160 of them, Meccano-like.\"\nThere is no confirmed starting date.\nRatcliffe says the project will depend on how 'quickly' the government are with kick-starting their regeneration project of the area.\n\"On the timeline for this, it starts with a discussion,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"It depends how quickly the government get going with their regeneration programme. I think they want to get going quite quickly, because they want to see progress in this parliament.\n\"I'm assuming that will go well and it will go quickly.\"\nUnited's chief operating officer Collette Roche says the club will work closely with the authorities to make the project proceed \"as smooth and quick as possible\".\n\"One of the things we are establishing is a mayoral development corporation, that gives a lot of rights to speed these things through,\" she added.\n\"You also heard today that Jim mentioned us potentially doing some pre-fabrication. So that means we can do a lot of the enabling works and start to design and build the pieces in advance of having to do anything on the ground in Old Trafford.\"\nIt is unclear what will happen to United's existing home - but it looks unlikely the current Old Trafford will be kept.\nArchitects Foster and Partners had suggested Old Trafford would be demolished - and there is no sign of the current stadium in the new artists impressions.\nGiven the proximity of the new stadium to the current site, this option looks likely.\n\"By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford,\" Ratcliffe said.\nIt had been suggested in 2024 that the current stadium could be scaled back and used as a home for United's women and youth teams.\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said the club may revisit that plan, but it is \"unlikely\".\nThat's the ambition.\nBerrada says the club wants to grow the women's team fanbase enough for them to play at the main stadium, which could incorporate matches or events with smaller capacities.\nHe added they were looking at pitch technology that would allow for the surface to be in \"mint condition\" for both the men's and women's teams.\nRoche added: \"The great thing about having this type of stadium is it can actually be creative for different venues.\n\"There is technology now that can still give you a sense of a smaller, great atmospheric stadium. That could benefit the women's team with a smaller crowd â and that's the kind of thing we are looking at.\"\nManchester United say the new stadium will cost about Â£2bn.\n\"We're looking at a ballpark [figure] of Â£2bn,\" Berrada told BBC sports editor Dan Roan.\nThe club have not said how the stadium will be financed.\nThere are several options on the table, such as loans, private investment or investment from co-owner Ratcliffe.\nHowever, the proposal to build a new Â£2bn stadium runs alongside the cost-cutting measures being made by Ratcliffe since his investment in the club.\n'What we're doing now is try to put ourselves in the best financial position to be able to finance a stadium and other infrastructure projects,\" said Berrada.\n\"Our aim is to be the most profitable club within three years. We think this will put us in the best financial footing to make this investment and to work with private investors who are willing to work with us.\"\nThe club are more than Â£1bn in debt.\nHowever, football finance expert Kieran Maguire says the club have more headroom to borrow money.\n\"The good news for Manchester United is that the club is in a position to borrow substantial sums, despite existing levels of debt,\" Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\"If the club does borrow a substantial amount of the estimated Â£2bn cost of the new stadium, it is likely to do so with some form of interest only loan.\n\"When Tottenham took a similar approach to building a new stadium in London a few years ago, they negotiated at very low interest rates. These loans have resulted in Tottenham's interest costs rising from Â£12m in the final season at White Hart Lane in 2016-17 to Â£46m in 2022-23. During that same period matchday income had increased by Â£72m and commercial income by Â£155m.\n\"The increase in commercial income is due to the club having a bigger multi-function stadium, used for a myriad football and non-football events such as NFL, music concerts and boxing.\"\nSpeaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Ratcliffe said: \"The financing is not the issue, I think it's eminently financeable. But the detail of that we'd rather talk about in the future. It will be financeable, I think.\"\nRatcliffe told the Overlap podcast, external that no public money will be used to build the stadium, but the project will not be possible without wider regeneration funded by the government.\n\"We can't afford to regenerate southern Manchester. It is too big a bill for the club,\" he said.\n\"We don't need any government funding for the stadium, but it has to be the underpin for the regeneration.\"\nAccording to Berrada, no.\n\"We don't want to inhibit our ability to invest in the team, for us to continue being competitive while we are building a new stadium,\" he added.\n\"There are various ways around that. One of the things we are looking at is to shorten the construction timelines.\n\"In the meantime, by getting our finances back in order and becoming profitable, we believe that we can be very competitive.\n\"The big, big benefit that this club has is that it has the biggest fanbase in the world and therefore the ability to be the number one in terms of revenues that it generates.\"\nRoche added: \"Our number one goal is to get our teams winning and to get the men's team competing for all the titles consistently. We are not going to deviate from that.\"\n'Some Man Utd players not good enough & overpaid'\nSir Jim Ratcliffe: The Interview\nThe new stadium is to be built next to Old Trafford, which Ratcliffe hopes will \"preserve the essence\" of their current home.\nThe new stadium will form part of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already given Government backing to the plans.\nUnited say the project has the potential to create 92,000 new jobs, bring an additional 1.8 million visitors to the area annually and will be worth an additional Â£7.3bn per year to the UK economy.\nOld Trafford's current capacity is 74,310, so the new stadium will accommodate more than 25,000 new spectators.\nHow will United fill it? And who will they be?\n\"Those Manchester United fans on the waiting list for season tickets may be disappointed if they thought the additional capacity of the stadium would result in many more season tickets becoming available,\" said Maguire.\n\"Manchester United have a huge global fanbase who are more likely to be willing to pay higher prices than those available to season ticket holders. Liverpool have in recent years increased the capacity of Anfield from 45,000 to over 61,000 as owners Fenway Sports Group have made most of the extra tickets available to fans in the membership scheme rather than those who want to have a coveted season ticket.\"\nIn a statement, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) said fans \"remain anxious\" about the plans and whether ticket prices will be driven up, forcing out local supporters.\n\"We look forward to further consultation with supporters discussing these vital questions with the club. If they are able to produce a new stadium as stunning as the plans suggest without harming the atmosphere, without hiking ticket prices and without harming investment elsewhere, then this could be very exciting.\n\"But until the questions are answered, our optimism about plans to make Old Trafford the biggest and the best again will be restrained by caution about what the consequences for fans might be.\"\nMan Utd's new Â£2bn stadium - all the key reaction and best images\nFans tell of hopes and fears for new Man Utd stadium\nThis video can not be played\nWatch promotional film of Man Utd's new stadium\nArchitects at Foster and Partners, who will design the project, said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is \"twice the size of Trafalgar Square\".\nThe design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200 metres high and visible from 25 miles away.\n\"As you move away from the stadium, it's not a fortress surrounded by a sea of cars.

Paris St-Germain and Lille are the representatives remaining in the Champions League, with Monaco and Brest exiting at the play-off stage. Lyon, in the Europa League, are the only other French side left in European competition.\nPortugal has two of its five teams remaining but lost Sporting and Porto in the Champions League and Europa League play-offs.\nEngland could end up with six Champions League teams next season.\nThe winners of the Europa League are also granted a Champions League slot.\nUnder previous rules, any single league could only have a maximum of five clubs in the Champions League. However, that rule has been scrapped.\nThis season, any team who win the Europa League but do not qualify for the Champions League via their domestic league position will go into the Champions League.\nThis raises the possibility of Manchester United or Tottenham, both through to the knockout stage of the Europa League but languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, qualifying for the Champions League alongside the top four or five.\nBy the time Uefa's three club competitions reached their quarter-final phase last season, the Premier League was well placed to claim one of the two coveted European performance slots.\nBut the elimination of Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool and West Ham shredded those hopes, with Aston Villa's exit in the semi-finals of the Conference League confirming the failure as Italy and Germany benefited.\nThe speedy collapse of those hopes means no-one will take anything for granted this time around.\nHowever, England is in an even stronger position this season. It would now take a complete capitulation for the Premier League's fifth-placed team not to qualify for next season's tournament.\nPremier League index\nPremier League table\nPremier League fixtures\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you"

gossip\nHuge sighs of relief will ring round Ibrox on Saturday as League Cup holders Rangers return from their temporary Hampden home in the second of two all-Premiership ties following Friday's meeting of Motherwell and Dundee United.\nThe Copland Stand will not be full as delayed renovation work continues, but the switch from the other side of Glasgow will be a welcome boost not only financially but also in terms of atmosphere.\nDundee's chances of a cup shock would also be greater if their nine-game unbeaten start to the season had not been ended last weekend as Rangers got back to winning ways after their own Old Firm reality check.\nThe Dark Blues' 2-0 defeat by Ross County in Dingwall means they have now gone three games without a victory, while the Light Blues recovered from their derby loss to Celtic by beating Dundee United 1-0 to secure their first away win.\nIt kept Rangers five points behind early Premiership leaders Celtic and Aberdeen and, just as importantly, eased some of the tension around the club after John Bennett's announcement that he was standing down as chairman citing health problems exacerbated by fan criticism.\nEven playing at Hampden, Philippe Clement's side have won all three of their domestic home games, their only reverse coming against Dynamo Kyiv in Champions League qualifying.\nHistory is also heavily on their side, with Dundee having to go back to October 1951 for a League Cup win over Rangers - 3-2 in the final.\nA Steven Davis goal was enough for the Glasgow side to win their last League Cup meeting two years ago at Ibrox.\nAnd, overall, Rangers are 13 unbeaten against Dundee since losing at Dens Park in November 2017 and have won 17 in a row at Ibrox since goals from Claudio Caniggia and Steven Milne secured the Dark Blues their last win there in March 2001.\nHowever, Tony Docherty's current side have shown they can give Rangers a bit of a fright, following up April's goalless draw at Dens Park a month later by leading twice at Ibrox before losing 5-2.\nThe visitors will be hoping Clement and his players this time have one eye on Thursday's Europa League visit to Malmo.\nDylan Tait scored Falkirk's second goal in their win over Hearts\nThere were high hopes for Dylan Tait when Hibs bought the midfielder, then aged 19, before loaning him back to Raith Rovers in August 2021.\nBut he would only make one appearance for the Premiership club and, after further loans to Kilmarnock, Arbroath, Hamilton Academical and Falkirk, he joined the latter on a permanent transfer this summer after helping them win League 1 and promotion.\nTait's top-flight dream having been dashed for now, he has eked out revenge on two Premiership sides already this season.\nHe scored in 2-0 group-stage defeat of Dundee United and again as Falkirk knocked out Heart of Midlothian in the last 16.\nHis four goals in 11 games this term are already one more than he has achieved in any full season and a repeat performance on Sunday would raise his profile further.\nHowever, the chances of a third Premiership scalp in a row are reduced by being drawn away to Scottish champions who lead the top-flight again after five straight wins and who are fresh from thrashing Slovan Bratislava 5-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday.\nIndeed, Falkirk have not beaten Celtic in 12 meetings since a 1-0 home league win in 2007, losing their latest League Cup meeting 3-1 in the 2012 semi-final then 3-0 in the Scottish Cup third round three years ago.\nHowever, the Bairns won - on penalties after a 1-1 draw - the last time the sides met at this stage in the League Cup, in November 2006.\nApart from losing a penalty shootout derby away to Stenhousemuir in the SPFL Trust Trophy, Tait and Falkirk have won eight of their past nine outings, lead the Championship and will travel to Glasgow determined for a repeat - and to prove their Premiership credentials.\nIt would be one of the biggest shocks in Scottish League Cup history if Aberdeen were not to extend their 10-game winning run since Jimmy Thelin took charge at the start of the season.\nPeople will point to the very same Dons' dismal Scottish Cup exit at the hands of Darvel - a side from Scotland sixth tier - in early 2023.\nAnd, yes, Spartans are two tiers higher and have already accounted for one Premiership side this season, as well as a Livingston team who were in the top division last season, to secure a first ever national cup quarter-final.\nBut this is a different Aberdeen, this time the minnows are having to travel to Pittodrie and part-time Spartans have only won once in five outings since knocking out Ross County.\nPeter Leven steadied the Dons ship in his second spell as caretaker last season after Neil Warnock's ill-fated short spell in charge, but Thelin has transformed their fortunes since.\nIt has Reds fans dreaming of going one better than last year's 1-0 defeat by Rangers in the final and lifting the trophy for the first time since edging Inverness Caledonian Thistle on penalties in 2014.\nThe 46-year-old Swede has himself only so far notched one trophy success - leading Jonkopings Sodra to the second-tier Superettan title a year later before finishing runner-up in the top flight twice with Elfsborg.\nWhile his rebuilt current side are only being kept off the top of the Premiership by Celtic on goal difference, Thelin has warned supporters not to get \"carried away\" by thoughts of winning the league title and will realise the cup is always the best chance for non-Old Firm clubs to win silverware."

        "title": "'Anything can happen' - Sunderland eye cup shock against Man Utd",
        "content": "Amy Goddard says Sunderland are \"excited\" to face holders Manchester United\nSunderland are up against the odds, but they are still dreaming.\nThey are the only team from outside the top flight who remain in the Women's FA Cup and face the in-form holders Manchester United away from home.\nBut their ambition for Saturday's quarter-final (17:15 GMT kick-off) is simple - to upset the odds and reach the last four.\n\"In an FA Cup game, anything can happen,\" defender Amy Goddard says. \"We're going to go there and hopefully put in a performance.\n\"We're not going to go there and expect to lose - we're going to go there and expect to win and that's the mindset that we've got to have.\"\nWhile this season has not gone as planned for Sunderland in the Women's Championship - they are sixth in the second tier, eight points off the top - their cup run presents a \"very exciting\" cause for celebration.\nLike some of her team-mates, 26-year-old Goddard has top-flight experience.\nShe has featured in the Women's Super League for Yeovil Town and has even faced United in this competition before when she was at Bridgwater United - something she says gives her hope for Sunderland's chances.\n\"We only lost 2-0 so I think in terms of that and the strength of the team that we've got now is completely different, so we can definitely put on a good performance and show them what we're about,\" she adds.\nShe is not the only person who will be familiar with United - manager Melanie Reay has recently been completing her Uefa Pro Licence course alongside Red Devils boss Marc Skinner.\nReay told BBC Radio Newcastle: \"We've had a lot of banter over the last 48 hours! They're going to take the game seriously as I would expect.\n\"We've got full respect for each other so I am expecting a very strong Manchester United team on Saturday night.\"\nSunderland will be without  top scorer Eleanor Dale on Saturday, who was ruled out after injuring her knee last month.\nHowever, the Black Cats head into the cup fixture in a positive mood after winning a local derby against title challengers Durham last weekend.\nUnited may be in the division above - but Saturday's cup game isn't a total mismatch. Sunderland, like many other second-tier outfits, are now fully professional and finished just five points shy of promotion last year.\nThe Women's Championship is rapidly becoming more professional - Goddard's side train four days a week as well as competing in their games at the weekend.\nThey will relish the opportunity against United, but are not just viewing it as a big day out. Goddard says Sunderland want to feature in high-profile fixtures more regularly in the future.\n\"You've got to play to the occasion but it's not just about that. As a group we all want to be playing against that kind of level week-in, week-out,\" she says.\nVictories over Portsmouth, Exeter and Huddersfield have got Sunderland to this stage, winning Â£169,000 in prize money in the process.\nAnother Â£90,000 is up for grabs for the winner on Saturday, while a defeat would net the losing side a further Â£22,000.\nRecent increases in the total prize fund makes the FA Cup an important source of income for clubs - especially those further down the pyramid.\n\"I think as the game's growing, more of a financial boost is great for the club,\" says Goddard.\n\"In terms of the club point of view, regardless of whatever competition you're in, you want to win and when there is the financial part to it that's obviously a little bit more important.\"\nWhile they are away from home at the weekend, Goddard says the Black Cats' vocal support will give them a boost.\nSunderland have benefited from strong attendances this term, especially when games have been played at the Stadium of Light - with 15,387 attending their league derby against Newcastle.\n\"I think in the north east, it's just different,\" she says. \"They live and breathe football. That's important for us as players.\n\"When you play on a Sunday, they are the 12th player on the field and every time something goes right you can hear them.\n\"Every phase of attack, you can hear them cheering you on and calling out your name and I think that's really important for us as players.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page"

        "title": "Bergvall controversy fuels Postecoglou's tirade on 'change'",
        "content": "This video can not be played\n'I thought people would protect the sanctity of the game'\nWednesday's Carabao Cup semi-final between Tottenham and Liverpool looked to be petering towards a largely forgettable draw, until late controversy was followed by a late winner.\nLucas Bergvall got the game's only goal with four minutes remaining for Spurs, but just moments before he had been involved in an incident that left some feeling he should not have even been on the pitch at that point, having escaped a second yellow card for bringing down Kostas Tsimikas.\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot was cautioned for his furious reaction to what had unfolded, and Sky Sports' pundits watching the game sympathised.\n\"It has a monumental effect on the game,\" said former Tottenham midfielder Jamie Redknapp.\n\"Tsimikas was off the pitch receiving treatment when Bergvall scored. So not only do you still have Bergvall on the pitch, it changes the shape of the game.\n\"If you are Liverpool you are thinking, 'how on earth is he still on the pitch?'.\"\nBut Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou insisted the laws of the game mean Bergvall wasn't lucky to stay on the pitch, before saying some strong words about the amount of change in football.\nSo what did happen?\n'Bergvall is headline act as young Spurs show incredible maturity'\nBergvall scores late winner as Spurs beat Liverpool in first leg\nTottenham's Bentancur taken off on stretcher after injury against Liverpool\n'I could not dream this' - who is new Spurs keeper Kinsky?\nThis video can not be played\n'Far from ideal'\nAlready on a booking, Bergvall brought down Tsimikas but play continued with Liverpool retaining possession.\nHowever, Tsimikas was then off the pitch receiving treatment when Bergvall scored to seal a 1-0 first-leg victory for Spurs.\nThe International Football Association Board's Laws of the Games state: \"If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play.\n\"However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goalscoring opportunity, the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.\"\nThe crucial part of the above is the final sentence. The offence - the foul by Bergvall - was interfering with a promising attack.\nIf referee Stuart Attwell did indeed play advantage then, applying the above, he did not have to go back and caution Bergvall.\nBut the laws also state \"advantage should not be applied in situations involving serious foul play, violent conduct or a second cautionable offence unless there is a clear opportunity to score a goal.\"\nWas this a clear opportunity to score? Debatable.\nAnge Postecoglou's Tottenham take a 1-0 advantage to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg\nAt the weekend, Tottenham boss Postecoglou described himself as \"the angriest he had been\" during the 2-1 loss to Newcastle after Anthony Gordon's equaliser had been allowed to stand after a handball in the build-up.\nAfter Wednesday's game, he said: \"I didn't think the decision was right about the handball. But I said, it's very hard at the moment, it's very confusing, to understand certain elements of the game.\n\"Now we've been told consistently in the last few weeks, because I've been screaming about it from the sidelines, because a lot of teams have got away with a lot of fouls with us, without bookings, because the referee plays advantage.\n\"We've been told consistently that if we play advantage, as long as it's not a cynical foul, then the player does not get cautioned. So that's been relayed to us on a weekly basis. Because we feel like that's been happening.\"\nLiverpool boss Slot had been furious with the decision at the time, and remained frustrated with it after the game.\nHe said: \"The decision he [the referee] made had a lot of impact on the result. There's not a lot I can say from that.\n\"The fourth official told me why he thought it wasn't a second yellow and he heard that probably from the referee. What we can say about it is that he said he didn't stop the counter-attack, every manager would say they prefer the second yellow than a counter-attack that goes on.\n\"It is what it is, we hate to lose but the positive is that it is better to lose when there is a second leg.\"\nPostecoglou has made it clear several times since managing in the Premier League that he is unhappy with where certain elements of the modern game are heading.\nDuring Wednesday's match at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, a decision by the video assistant referee (VAR) was announced to the stadium for the first time in England, after Dominic Solanke had a second-half strike ruled out for offside.\nAfter the game, Postecoglou embarked on a lengthy critique of football and where it could be heading.\nHe said: \"I'm really surprised at how, what's the word I'm looking for, how people in this country are so easily letting the game change so much so quickly. It's changed more since VAR has come in since I've been involved than in the past 50 years.\n\"We never used to debate offsides, we never used to debate handballs, we never used to debate holding in the box, we never used to debate so many things.\n\"I mean, did everyone really love the announcement today? Did that give you a real buzz about, you know, I mean, seriously, but now I'm, and again, look, I understand, my understanding of it is, this is what the people want. That's what I keep getting told.\n\"I understand that. I understand VAR is going to be there, technology's going to be a part of life, but it's like my wife and our kids. We know technology but she limits screen time. Why? You know, slow things down, I think.\n\"We've just got to be careful about constantly - why do we want to change the game so much? And I know I'm going to be the old bloke in the stands that keeps shouting 'boo' every time and I'll be the only one, but I just thought people would be a little bit more protective about the sanctity of the game.\n\"That's what I was talking about. I wasn't criticising referees, I wasn't. I've never criticised, I didn't think the decision was right, but it's just the way the game, I think there's a lot of confusion at the moment.\n\"That's my belief that the game is changing on the basis of technology, and I'm saying why isn't anyone speaking up about it? Especially in this country who, for all intents and purposes, you feel, you guys think you're custodians of the game, you've got a song that says 'it's coming home', this is your game, and yet it takes an Aussie from the other side of the world to be the one that's most conservative about changes.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

Which side can be the most consistent?\nFalkirk and Ayr play their games in hand over Livingston on Tuesday night, with John McGlynn's league leaders facing bottom side Airdrieonians live on BBC Scotland and iPlayer.\nAt the same time, Scott Brown's third-place Ayr United visit play-off chasing Queen's Park.\nCome full-time Falkirk could be four points clear of Livingston and six in front of Ayr. Or, there could be three sides separated by a single point.\nThen it could all change again when Livingston play Raith Rovers on Wednesday.\nIt is only the start of a run-in that looks set to be compelling right to the final minutes of the season.\nFalkirk clear at top after stoppage-time equaliser with Hamilton\nAyr United sink Airdrie to make up ground in title race\nRhys McCabe's Airdrieonians looked dead and buried not that long ago, having shocked the division last season by reaching the play-offs after promotion.\nBut in the past two months they have started to piece together what would be a highly improbable comeback.\nThey had won only one Championship match all season until their 3-0 victory over Dunfermline on 25 January - but a four-game unbeaten league run followed to breathe some life into their campaign.\nA 4-1 loss at the hands of Ayr at the weekend brought that to an end, and Airdrie are still 10 points adrift of their nearest rivals in the table, Dunfermline.\nBut if they were to somehow survive the drop it would have to go down as one of the greatest Scottish football survival stories.\nHowever, time is running out, as defender Lewis Strapp is all too aware of.\n\"I'm expecting a reaction, first and foremost,\" he said after the Ayr loss.\n\"We're all a bit devastated, but on Tuesday we expect to go out there and for everyone to be at it.\n\"Even the boys coming off the bench, everybody needs to be ready to go.\n\"We've got 10 games left, we can't sit back and look at these results â we just need to keep looking forward.\"\nAirdrieonians have lost both matches to Falkirk 2-0 this season, but they have won their past three home games.\nBoth sides are desperate for points, as is every team in a league of fine margins."

        "content": "Simone Magill hit a 93rd minute winner as Northern Ireland defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina\nSimone Magill turned and punched the air as the final whistle blew at Inver Park.\nNorthern Ireland's captain and talismanic striker, Magill was the hero with two late goals to stun Bosnia-Herzegovina.\nDespite a dominant opening 45 minutes from Northern Ireland, they were staring in the face of a fourth consecutive defeat after the Bosnians hit a quickfire double after a restart.\nBut up stepped Magill, who produced a captain's performance with two late goals.\nIn the 89th minute, she headed Ellie Mason's long ball into the bottom corner to drag her side level.\nThe same combination worked again in the 93rd minute as Magill controlled Mason's pass and tucked the ball into the bottom corner.\nMagill rescues NI with injury-time winner against Bosnia-Herzegovina\nOxtoby praises NI's 'resilience' in late Bosnia-Herzegovina win\nShe had rescued her side from the brink, and there was joy and relief around the ground in equal measure.\n\"To win a game like that, that's why you play the game and love football so much,\" Magill said after the game.\n\"I'm extremely happy now but we didn't make that easy on ourselves.\n\"I'm so proud of the character of the group, not only did we come back but we didn't settle for a draw.\n\"We pushed on for the three points. To do that, and the way that we did it, I'm really happy.\"\nIt was a strange game for Northern Ireland, who went from being in complete control to looking shell-shocked in the space of five minutes after half-time.\nTanya Oxtoby's side took a deserved first-half lead through Brenna McPartland's header, but they allowed Bosnia into the game.\nFirst of all, less than 60 seconds after the restart, Emina Ekic was allowed to run unchallenged from her own half to slot home the equaliser.\nThree minutes later, a poor clearance by Rachel Dugdale was punished when Marija Milinkovic fired home a stunning 20-yard effort off the post.\nWhile Tuesday's game had a happy ending, not being able to string a full 90-minute performance together can be a frustration when you see what Northern Ireland are capable of in fits and starts.\nAnother worrying trend is the quickfire concession of goals, which also happened against Poland on Friday and again in the first leg of the Euro 2025 play-off with Norway before Christmas.\nMagill admits there was an \"element of complacency\" after dominating the first half, and her side must learn from that heading into April's double-header with Romania.\n\"That's what we were going after, we wanted to be in control of the game,\" Magill said.\n\"I think with control comes an element of complacency, and if we look at the second half that's exactly what did happen.\n\"Ultimately, we do need to learn from those moments at the start of the second half. That can't happen again.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMagill late show rescues Nations League win for Northern Ireland\nAfter October's Euro 2025 play-off victory over Croatia, when Lauren Wade scored an extra-time winner, NI could not build on that winning moment against European giants Norway as they missed out on reaching this summer's tournament.\nBut this time, they will be favourites against Romania and have a real opportunity to carry the momentum and feeling from Tuesday's game into that window.\nMagill believes the resilience shown by Northern Ireland can be \"the springboard\" for Oxtoby's youthful team going forward.\nThe Birmingham City striker will get the headlines, and rightly so after her heroics, but there were others who played their part.\nThe 30-year-old praised 18-year-old striker Kascie Weir, making her first start, defender Mason, who provided the two late assists, and substitute Emily Wilson, who was impressive with her aggressive approach on the wing.\n\"It's how we reacted after that, that's what I'm really proud of.\n\"We've spoken a lot about the growth of this team, and it would have been really easy to go into our shell and not chase after the game to go and get something.\n\"When we scored the equaliser, we ran straight back to get the ball to go again. It's a credit to everyone that we got the win.\""

        "title": "'Southgate deserves respect but was not the winner England wanted'",
        "content": "Gareth Southgate leaves England with a managerial record of played 102, won 61, drawn 24, lost 17 - a 59.8% win rate\nGareth Southgateâs eight years as England manager will be judged as an age of progress in many areas, but ultimately one of falling agonisingly short when it came to claiming the big prizes.\nSouthgate leaves following the Euro 2024 final defeat by Spain, with a better record than anyone in the job since 1966 World Cup winner Sir Alf Ramsey, deserving total respect for the manner in which he handled the unique pressures of being England manager.\nAnd Englandâs consistent appearances in the latter stages of major tournaments was a sharp contrast to the fallow years of embarrassing exits under predecessors Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson - the one-match reign of Sam Allardyce being the Football Associationâs âblink and you missed itâ moment.\nThis is why Southgate can leave with his head held high, and able to reflect on a fine body of work that restored England as a serious proposition on the global stage.\nThere is no escape, however, from the brutal reality that when measured against the opportunities which presented themselves in four major tournaments, along with the talent at his disposal, Southgate could not lead England over the line.\nIt may be a harsh judgement to regard Southgate as a nearly England manager leading a nearly England team, but that running theme of close, but not close enough leaves him open to those charges.\nLegacies are shaped by such fine margins.\nIf England had beaten Spain in Berlin to win their first major menâs trophy for 58 years, Southgate would have been transformed from a maligned figure - facing hostility and flying beer cups in Cologne after England failed to beat Slovenia in the group stage - to a national hero and sporting icon.\nInstead, Southgateâs record of near misses meant England and the Football Association could not find the managerial winner they have craved since 1966.\nAll the reaction after Southgate quits as England manager\nSouthgate resigns after England's Euro 2024 loss\nBest since Ramsey? How does Southgate's record compare?\nSouthgateâs peak of popularity arguably came between 2018 and 2021 when he led England to a surprise World Cup semi-final against Croatia in Moscow and then a  Euros final against Italy at Wembley - but both were lost from winning positions, the manner of those defeats used as prime examples of the occasional tactical inertia and conservatism that provided a regular backdrop to his regime.\nHe placed England back to what had become alien territory in the previous decade of the latter stages of major tournaments, but was still treated with scepticism in some quarters. The latest gallant loss to Spain in Berlinâs Olympiastadion means Southgate could not pull off the history-making triumph that would change those minds.\nIn the wider context, Southgate was a calm, measured personality who achieved the not inconsiderable feat of making a nation fall in love with its football team once more, leading with dignity on and off the field, demonstrating a willingness to tackle thorny subjects away from the playing arena with his measured words on racism and other issues.\nThe modern England manager must have a wider hinterland than simply football as all issues are now seen as fair game for his views. Southgate possesses it, serving him and the Football Association well when the gameâs waves spread beyond the pitch.\nSouthgate was the subject of a successful West End production Dear England, the title taken from an open letter he wrote to Englandâs fans before Euro 2020. A post-Germany plot revision of the piece will not have the happy ending writer James Graham hoped for, as Southgateâs England could not deliver the winning storyline against Spain.\nThe relationship between Southgate and England fans was sometimes uneasy, as seen in those angry scenes against Slovenia, but such is the fickle nature of that volatile union that he was dancing in front of those same supporters receiving raucous acclaim after Switzerland were beaten on penalties.\nHe was serenaded by supporters during those heady days between 2018 and 2021, then singled out for fierce criticism when the expectations he helped to raise were not fulfilled, such is the precarious existence of Englandâs manager.\nSouthgate suffered personal abuse from supporters that made him question his future before and after the Qatar World Cup in 2022.\nBut the 53-year-oldâs time in charge must always be viewed through the prism of what he inherited when Englandâs former under-21 manager agreed a four-year contract in November 2016.\nThe FA was in chaos following Sam Allardyceâs one-game reign in succession to the humiliated Roy Hodgson, who presided over the national embarrassment of defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016.\nEnglandâs direction of travel was a rapid downhill spiral after the failures of predecessors Capello and Hodgson. Southgate privately distanced himself from succeeding Hodgson before accepting a four-year contract to take over after the turbulent 67 days of Allardyce.\nMature and civilised, Southgate rarely lost his composure and was at ease under the fierce scrutiny accompanying his status, Englandâs new manager quickly embarking on a period of culture change\nSouthgate delivered an opening mission statement insisting England had to âget off the islandâ and learn from elsewhere, particularly the German model of strong connections between the DFB (German football association) and the domestic Bundesliga.\nGareth Southgate was England Under-21 manager before taking the senior role\nSouthgateâs first game in permanent charge - after four as interim manager - was a 1-0 friendly loss to Germany in Dortmund in March 2017. He gave new caps to defender Michael Keane and midfielders Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse on the start of a journey to Englandâs first World Cup semi-final since 1990 in Moscow the following summer.\nFrom the angst and discontent of the debacle at Euro 2016 in France under Hodgson, Southgateâs more collegiate and open approach changed the mood instantly.\nCapello's fierce, brusque style and the rigid repetition of Hodgsonâs methods were out. Southgateâs modern outlook was in.\nEnglandâs players felt the weight of the shirt, so often referred to as an impossible burden by Capello, lifted. They were happy to represent their country again.\nAs his England renewal took shape, those who played for Southgate admired and respected him as someone who was loyal, who backed those players who produced for him, and would be prepared to act as a willing shield for them when the criticism, as it invariably does, started to fly.\nWho will be next England manager?\nHow much do you know about Southgate's time as England boss?\n'Thank you Gareth - you gave a nation new memories'\nHe showed private and public support for Harry Maguire, a key figure in Englandâs renaissance, who became a figure of mockery for his own and opposition supporters. It was seen with his loyalty to Kalvin Phillips, who was a central figure in the Euro 2020 finals but fell from grace spectacularly after moving to Manchester City, and then West Ham United on loan. He was only excluded when Southgate could no longer justify his inclusion.\nSouthgate was at the forefront on a shameful night in Sofia in October 2019, when a Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria, which England won 6-0, was stopped twice after Tyrone Mings and Raheem Sterling were targeted for vicious racist abuse.\nAnd those of us who witnessed Southgate dealing with hostile Bulgarian questioning, with some locals denying there was a problem, could not fail to be hugely impressed. Southgate made his point while always issuing the caution that England had problems of its own in this regard and must not believe it was something that only existed elsewhere.\nIt was the reaction of a serious, decent person who saw his role at the FA as more than just the manager of the senior football team.\nSouthgate was put in temporary charge of the senior England team on 27 September 2016\nHe had already made his mark before taking the job permanently, showing the hidden steel that lurked beneath the smooth exterior, by effectively ending the England career of then all-time leading goalscorer and captain Wayne Rooney by dropping him for a World Cup qualifier in Slovenia. Rooney only figured three more times as he was eased aside, the last a ceremonial farewell in a friendly against Scotland.\nFor a manager incorrectly tagged as âtoo niceâ to take tough decisions, Southgate never shied away. It was seen when Sterlingâs international career was brought to an abrupt close after the 2022 World Cup, then when Ben Chilwell, Jack Grealish, Jordan Henderson and James Maddison were cut from the Euro 2024 squad.\nThe media, kept at armâs length and operating under an apparent âgive them nothingâ restriction at Euro 2016, were welcomed into Englandâs Russian World Cup base two years later. They were even invited to play darts against Southgateâs squad, a tradition that was maintained here in Germany, along with a football match between the media and Englandâs backroom staff, managed by Kieran Trippier.\nEven the sight of Southgate with his arm in a sling after dislocating his shoulder, after falling over while out running, was only a bump in the road as England were a surprise package, reaching the semi-final only to lose to Croatia in extra time after taking an early lead through Trippierâs free-kick.\nEngland lost control of a game they had in their grasp. It was a flaw they displayed too often in the big moments under Southgate and led to doubts about his game management and tactical flexibility against high-class opposition.\nThe unlikely nature of Englandâs campaign made Southgate and his squad hugely popular, the managerâs trademark waistcoat transforming him into something of a fashion icon.\nSouthgate dropped England captain Wayne Rooney in his second game in charge, giving him 17 minutes off the bench in a 0-0 draw in Slovenia\nIf there was one game in Southgateâs reign that summed up where the fault lines lay, it was the great missed opportunity of the Euro 2020 final against Italy at Wembley. This will surely be the game of biggest single regret, even ahead of Sundayâs loss in Berlin.\nEngland were effectively presented with a home tournament, just one game being played away from Wembley in Rome, where Ukraine were thrashed 4-0 in the quarter-final.\nAfter Denmark were beaten in the semi-final, England once again went ahead through Luke Shaw after two minutes but, as against Croatia and in a familiar pattern under Southgate, they went into retreat, allowing an Italy side that was hardly vintage to dominate, equalise then take the final to penalties.\nEngland allowed matters to drift - Southgate waiting until extra time to introduce Grealish - then the later stages to bring on Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, who barely had any time to get attuned to the occasion, then missing penalties in the shootout England lost.\nEnglandâs painful loss was the final straw on a dreadful day marred by fan disorder, with ugly scenes inside and outside Wembley. What could have been a golden day for Southgate, a defining moment for manager and players, was a nightmare as the shadow of racism hung over the aftermath when Rashford, Sancho and Bukayo Saka were shamefully abused after missing penalties in the shootout.\nBy the time the following summer rolled around, the first signs that Southgate was falling from favour with a once-adoring public could be seen and heard.\nSouthgate may have sensed it himself as he talked of ânot outstaying my welcomeâ before a Nations League meeting with Hungary at Molineux. If he had not, he soon got the message as he was subjected to personal abuse after a 4-0 loss, with chants also echoing around the stadium.\nIt had a profound effect on a manager who saw strength in unity - management, players and supporters - and was always aware of the danger of him becoming a divisive figure.\nOnce again, this was a recurring theme.\nSouthgate took the England men's team to a first major final since 1966, losing Euro 2020 on penalties to Italy at Wembley\nSouthgate considered leaving once more after the World Cup quarter-final loss to France in Qatar. Indeed many inside the FA were quietly convinced the search for a new manager would soon be an item on their agenda.\nThe sympathetic and positive response to Englandâs efforts in Qatar shaped his decision to stay, with a contract signed to take him through Euro 2024 to November.\nIn Germany, there had been an âend of daysâ feel to a flat, disjointed campaign, with Southgate losing touch on tactics and feeling fan hostility again.\nSouthgate, normally so assured when faced with the awkward, searching questions, found his voice faltering when asked about the abuse, which played into all his fears about becoming someone who would split supporters and his team.\nHe took bold decisions to include youngsters Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United and Crystal Palaceâs Adam Wharton in Englandâs squad but did not appear to have a clear midfield plan, describing his flawed strategy to play Liverpoolâs Trent Alexander-Arnold in the middle as an experiment.\nSouthgate also received criticism from outside for name-checking Kalvin Phillips as a key absentee, but this was unjust. He, in fact, stated England were missing a Phillips-type reliable, physical holding player, not Phillips himself.\nHe was presented with a generational talent in Jude Bellingham, alongside Premier League Player of the Season Phil Foden and Englandâs all-time record scorer Harry Kane, who looked so out of sorts in Germany - but struggled in vain to reach a formula, a manager seemingly running out of inspiration.\nGareth Southgate had simply run out of road as England manager.\nHe could not take England to a place they have craved since 1966 â but Southgate leaves with them in a much better place than when he arrived, and with a record that makes him the countryâs second greatest manager since Ramsey."

Players must also be at their best, show commitment and bear in mind that we can all fly together to reach our goal.\"\nWhat will 'ambitious' Chelle bring to Nigeria job?\nHow Osimhen went from Lagos hawker to 'African king'\nOsimhen is on loan at Turkish giants Galatasaray this season and has scored 23 goals in 28 appearances in all competitions\nNigeria, runners up at Afcon 2023, have been drawn alongside Tunisia, Uganda and Tanzania in the group stage for the 2025 edition of the finals.\nBut after missing out on the title to hosts Ivory Coast last time around, Osimhen hopes it will be a different story in Morocco later this year.\n\"It's not going to be easy because African football is unpredictable, we all saw how some big teams went out early in Ivory Coast,\" he said.\n\"We must take each game as it comes and remember that we are yet to win anything for Nigeria. That should be the motivation we need to go one step better.\n\"But we cannot focus too much on a tournament that will happen at the end of the year when we have big demands of the World Cup before that.

It is not the pressure that we face but the desire to not let ourselves and the country down.\n\"Playing at the World Cup is a priority and we must make it happen this time around.\"\nHow does new African World Cup qualifying work?"

        "content": "The first 32-team Fifa Club World Cup takes place across June and July in the USA\nNew European Leagues president Claudius Schafer says he \"fears for the future\" of domestic competitions because of the distortion created by prize money from international tournaments.\nOn Wednesday, world governing body Fifa announced prize money of $1bn (Â£780m) for this summer's 32-team Club World Cup in the United States.\nThe actual fees will rise depending on performance at the tournament, which is likely to benefit the 12 European clubs. The top nine sides in the betting markets are all from Europe, with Austria's Red Bull Salzburg the only European team not favoured to reach the last 16.\nWhile Fifa has said it will provide $200m (Â£155m) to European football in solidarity payments for non-participating clubs, it has not been explained exactly where this money will go.\nHowever, Schafer suggested the solidarity aspect was largely irrelevant - and raised concerns about the impact of substantial prize money on the competitive balance in \"smaller and mid-sized leagues\".\n\"When you see the money being paid to those participating in the competition this summer, it is huge,\" he said.\n\"If an Austrian league club gets $50m, that has a huge influence on [that]  league.\n\"Competitive balance is one of the most important topics for a league.\n\"The smaller and mid-sized leagues have had very good discussions about solidarity, but we have to be frank - it is a small portion if a club is participating in international competition. I fear for the future to be honest.\"\nLeagues across Europe are wrestling with the issue of dominance from a small number of clubs - including England where Manchester City won an unprecedented fourth title in a row last season.\nThe last time a team other other than Real Madrid, Barcelona or Atletico Madrid won Spain's La Liga was in 2004, Juventus clinched nine straight Italian Serie A titles to 2020, while Bayern Munich look set to reclaim their Bundesliga crown this term after Bayer Leverkusen ended their 11-season streak in Germany.\nElsewhere, Paris St-Germain look certain to make it 12 titles in 14 years in France, while Red Bull Salzburg won 10 Austrian titles in a row to 2024.\n\"We have to come up with some conclusions,\" said Schafer.\nThe inaugural expanded Club World Cup begins on 14 June and finishes with the final in New Jersey on 13 July.\nFifa to give $1bn as Europe nears Club World Cup deal\nHow does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?\nDAZN secures exclusive Fifa Club World Cup rights\nDespite further discussions between leagues, there has been no decision yet on when the summer transfer window will close.\nFifa has said leagues with teams in the Club World Cup are allowed to do business in a window from 1 June to 10 June. However, that could affect when the window opens again and, more importantly, when it closes.\nThe Premier League closed its window before the season began in 2018 but abandoned that concept after two years because the other European leagues kept their windows open until the end of August.\nThere is an acceptance it would be better to close transfer windows at the same time, but issues over different start dates and the impact of European qualifiers make implementation difficult.\n\"There is not yet a consensus on the summer transfer window,\" said Marc Lenz, chief executive of Germany's Bundesliga.\n\"It would be a positive to close earlier. We got the signal from our commission of football, which has representatives of sporting directors, that it could be a good sign.\n\"But we need to find a consensus among top leagues because there might be consequences that are unforeseen.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

The most important thing right now is to move forward to the big cup final on Saturday.\"\nCushing will be in charge for the remainder of the season, having previously helped City win the WSL and the FA Cup, plus the League Cup twice, before leaving in January 2020 to join MLS side New York City.\n\"We were excited by that appointment because he knows the club really well, he's been here before, he comes with a huge history of winning and his mentality to win is second to none,\" said Greenwood, who is currently sidelined with a knee injury.\n\"I had a really, really good chat with him on Tuesday morning.\n\"He had a great meeting with the team - a really, really positive one. It was ultimately about winning and what is achievable, what we need to focus on, which, first of all, is Saturday.\"\nFormer Manchester City players Ellen White and Jen Beattie, who both played under Taylor, have questioned the timing of the sacking.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast, White said: \"Very odd timing I would say - it's super strange.\n\"I feel a bit sorry for him because [he has] a lot of injuries. But you've got to throw it back to the club at the same time to be like - are you invested into this team, where do you want this team to go?\n\"He could have gone months ago, last year potentially. I don't think they're in that bad a position at the moment.

He's very diligent, he's very tactical, he's good at communication and he loves being on the grass. He's a very, very good coach.\"\nBeattie played under Cushing for four seasons at City and was part of the WSL-winning side in 2016 and won two FA Cups and two League Cups under him.\n\"In my experience under Nick, Nick had this unbelievable ability to make you focus on the task in hand and to be able to shut out the noise,\" she said.\n\"He will be able to take this chaotic time for the team, simplify it, and allow them to focus on the games.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page"

Meanwhile, second-placed Arsenal have dropped points in each of their past three games - including their 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday.\n\"Liverpool will look at it and think 'Arsenal have almost given up the title race',\" former Manchester United captain Roy Keane said on Sky Sports.\nAnd former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson added: \"I will be saying now that Arsenal need to concentrate to get into the Premier League top four.\n\"Liverpool are too far away.

        "content": "Linfield are 16 points clear at the top of the Irish Premiership\nAs we edge ever closer towards the end of the season, Linfield are in a strong position to lift the Irish Premiership title.\nDavid Healy's side are 16 points clear of Glentoran in second place despite a strong recent run of form from the east Belfast side.\nGlentoran have a game in hand over Linfield but it seems a matter of when, not if, the Blues, who also have a superior goal difference, are crowned champions.\nIn short, Linfield require four wins from their final eight matches to secure the title.\nHere's how things stand in the table as we approach the business end of the season.\nCarrick stun Larne as Glentoran and Glenavon win\nAfter Larne won the title in the past two seasons, it looks like the Gibson Cup is heading back to Windsor Park.\nGlentoran defeated Ballymena United on Tuesday to move three points closer to their rivals, but if anything it has consolidated second place, rather than put any huge pressure on the Blues.\nThree of the Linfield's final eight matches take place before the Irish Premiership is split into two halves for the remaining five fixtures - when the top six teams face each other and likewise with teams in the bottom half.\nIn theory, they could have it wrapped up by then.\nHere's a look at the fixtures for the top two.\nThe Glens are in action in the BetMcLean Cup final against Cliftonville on Sunday, which could allow Linfield to take another step closer to the title if they defeat Crusaders in front of the BBC cameras on Friday night.\nWhile Linfield are just four wins away, that's also assuming Glentoran pick up maximum points from their remaining fixtures. Any slip-ups from Declan Devine's side will put Linfield closer to the trophy.\nTheoretically, Linfield could win the title as early as 15 March if they defeat Crusaders and Glenavon, and Glentoran lose at home to both Paddy McLaughlin's rejuvenated Lurgan Blues and away to Carrick Rangers.\nThe Glens also face tricky tests at home to Larne and Crusaders before the split, while Linfield face Dungannon Swifts.\nBehind the top two, there are eight points separating third place to eighth as teams battle for the European places.\nThe top two in the Irish Premiership automatically qualify for European football in the summer, along with the play-off winner and Irish Cup champion.\nThe play-off consists of the teams from third to seventh in the Irish Premiership at the end of the season.\nIt's been a stunning campaign for Dungannon Swifts under Rodney McAree, who has developed and guided one of the most exciting teams in the Irish Premiership.\nThe Swifts are third in the table and are in the semi-finals of the Irish Cup, so two avenues to European football are still open.\nCrusaders have been hot and cold, but hold fourth in the table while holders Larne have been playing catch up due to their own, historic European exploits before Christmas.\nIrish Cup holders and this year's semi-finalists Cliftonville round out the top six, while in the second half of the table Portadown, Coleraine, Glenavon and Ballymena United are in contention for a European play-off spot.\nThe title race and relegation battle (which you can read about below) may be fairly clear cut, but the race for Europe promises to be extremely exciting.\nHere's how things stand in the bottom half of the Irish Premiership table as the split draws ever closer.\nAt the bottom, Loughgall's relegation could be confirmed before that even takes place.\nIt's been a difficult second year back in the top flight for Dean Smith's side, and they are currently 12 points adrift at the bottom.\nCarrick Rangers are also in no man's land in the relegation/promotion play-off spot despite their dramatic victory over Larne on Tuesday.\nHere are their final fixtures before the split.\nLoughgall face two tough fixtures against Larne and Crusaders before a final pre-split fixture at home to Ballymena United.\nIf they are 15 points adrift heading into the spilt then their relegation into the Championship will be confirmed.\nDean Smith's side also have the worst goal difference in the league, so will need a miracle if they are to claw their way to safety.\nWith the tight nature of the middle of the table - as we mentioned above - both Carrick and Loughgall will have to wait to see who they will play in the split.\nAfter picking up their first win since November on Tuesday, Carrick will be hoping to stick a run of form together to move further up the bottom half.\nHowever, preparation for a relegation/promotion play-off with a Championship side looks the more likely outcome at this stage."

        "title": "The journey to Northern Ireland's national training centre",
        "content": "It has been mooted for many years but finally, a National Training Centre [NTC] for Northern Ireland looks set to become a reality.\nThe Irish FA's long-held ambition of building a facility will be realised on Wednesday with the announcement that a site located next to the Galgorm Resort, just outside Ballymena, will be its location.\nIt is anticipated the centre will consist of elite pitches and facilities for men's, women's and youth teams, with planning permission being requested to proceed with plans for development at the County Antrim venue.\nBefore the official reveal of details of the venture, BBC Sport NI examines how we reached this point and what impact the construction of the facility may have on football in Northern Ireland.\nBack in June 2011, IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson articulated an 'on-the-record' goal on behalf of the governing body to build a NTC for the improvement of the game in Northern Ireland.\nHis comments were recorded in a response to questions, external after an address to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure at the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nNelson explained the organisation's vision that the permanent structure would be a centre which could be used by all Northern Ireland's international teams and would provide them with \"the best facilities, the best sports science and the best diet and nutrition advice\" as they sought to provide optimum preparation to help teams qualify for major tournaments.\nAt the time, he also floated the idea that a separate regional training facility could be built outside Belfast as \"a lot of things tended to be Belfast-based\".\nIn a nutshell, the IFA have been seeking to match increased levels of professionalism and player development across their jurisdiction with a permanent facility.\nThe men's senior team has prepared for games at a number of locations in recent years, including training in Manchester before matches.\nThe ultimate goal remains to give squads the best opportunities to regularly emulate the feats of the men's national team in qualifying for Euro 2016 and the women's team in reaching the finals of their European championships in 2021.\nNorthern Ireland training sessions could soon be held at the new training centre\nThe ambition to build a NTC has been a stated priority of the IFA for many years and formed a central part of the organisation's strategic plans in both 2017 and 2022.\nThe five-year strategy published in June 2017, external saw the potential addition of a top-class facility as a way to build on Euro 2016 qualification and the construction of the new National Stadium at Windsor Park.\nAt that stage, the ambition was to build a state-of-the-art hub and training facility similar to the English FA's St George's Park, preferably within three years.\nThis would act as centre of excellence for every Northern Ireland team and could include elements such as medical facilities, a physiotherapy clinic and a gym.\nThe 2022 edition, external of the IFA's corporate strategy roadmap reaffirmed its commitment to a world-class standard NTC as a vital component of the progression of the game.\nThe Association's president Conrad Kirkwood told BBC Sport NI in January of that year that he was optimistic funding would soon materialise and he may have news to announce in relation to a facility later in 2022.\nIFA technical director Aaron Hughes has also emphasised a national training centre as one of his priorities.\nThe 112-times capped international was involved in discussions on the subject while in a part-time consultancy role before occupying his present position, and in an interview with BBC Sport NI in December 2022 highlighted the possible benefits.\n\"It's how we build a culture and create that level of excellence. Not just the facility but the feeling it creates,\" he explained.\n\"It brings everyone together, everyone within that has an understanding of why they come to work and what they're working for. There's so much more to a National Training Centre than just pitches. That's why it would be one of our key priorities.\"\nMichael O'Neill was part of an Irish FA group that inspected various locations in 2019\nAmong the developments in recent years has been the introduction of the IFA's pathway for young elite players, with their Club NI programme evolving into the JD National Performance Programme and the JD Irish FA Academy, based at the University of Ulster's Jordanstown campus, to nurture young talent and help inspire the next generation of young stars.\nMeanwhile attempts to access funding and a suitable site have continued.\nPreviously approximately Â£3m of government funding was understood to have been earmarked for a new NTC from a Sub-Regional Stadia Programme for Football of Â£36.2m in total.\nThat pot has now been renamed as the Northern Ireland Football Fund and it is expected that despite the IFA linking up with a private concern for the NTC, some investment from the Northern Ireland Assembly will still be forthcoming for the project.\nWhen launching the NI Football Fund in May 2024, Communities Minister Gordon Lyons explained that the creation of a NTC formed one of three strands which the fund would support and said that he was \"looking forward to fostering our footballing stars of the future with the creation of a National Training Centre\".\nHe reassured doubters by saying that \"work is progressing at pace on a NTC for Football to host elite training for our national men's, women's and youth teams and to drive skills for people involved at all levels of the game.\"\nIn September 2023, Northern Ireland's record men's goalscorer David Healy was vocal in his criticism of the IFA for failing to supply the right infrastructure and support to build on participation in the Euro 2016 finals.\nHis comments were made in his role as a television pundit after the team had suffered a fifth defeat in a row in their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign - a 1-0 defeat to Kazakhstan.\nIn response, the IFA said that \"extensive research\" was being put into creating \"a bespoke high quality facility\" and \"a second home for Northern Ireland football to complement the excellent venue at the National Stadium at Windsor Park\".\n\"The Irish FA will make a significant investment into the facility and anticipates utilising capital funding from external sources, particularly those that that are designed to support national associations in these types of strategic infrastructure projects,\" read the IFA's statement.\nIn January 2025, the IFA was the subject of criticism from Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council after it ruled out basing its new centre at a site in the Birch Hill Road area of Antrim.\nA spokesperson for the IFA told BBC News NI: \"The council were clear at all times that Birch Hill Road was under strategic consideration along with several other locations, and that exploratory discussions about the site were at preliminary stages.\n\"No formal arrangements were ever agreed and we maintain an excellent relationship with Antrim & Newtownabbey Borough Council.\""

        "content": "From left: Gareth Southgate, Sven-Goran Eriksson, Terry Venables and Bobby Robson have all managed England at major tournaments\nIt is the end of an era as Gareth Southgate leaves his role as England manager.\nOver the past eight years, the Three Lions have reached the semi-finals of a World Cup and suffered final heartbreak at both Euro 2020 and 2024.\nBut is Southgate the country's best manager since Sir Alf Ramsey - the only boss to win the World Cup with England?\nBBC Sport has looked at every England manager after Ramsey - and you have the chance to rank them in order at the bottom.\nOnly Walter Winterbottom (139) and Sir Alf Ramsey (113) have taken charge of more England matches than Gareth Southgate\nTournament record: Fourth at 2018 World Cup, runners-up at Euro 2020, quarter-final at 2022 World Cup, runners-up at Euro 2024.\nOverall record: Played 102, won 61, drawn 24, lost 17, scored 213, conceded 72, win ratio 59.8%.\nGareth Southgate took temporary charge of the England side in September 2016, and was unbeaten in four games, earning the role on a permanent basis.\nFor the first time since 1990, England's men's team reached the semi-finals of a World Cup in 2018, losing to Croatia after extra time. They went even further at the European Championship in 2021, but lost to Italy on penalties in the Wembley final.\nA quarter-final loss to France in the 2022 World Cup followed. Southgate contemplated leaving the role after that tournament but stayed on, taking England to the final at Euro 2024, where they lost to Spain.\nSam Allardyce never got to manage England at Wembley, with his only game in charge coming in Trnava, Slovakia\nOverall record: Played one, won one, drawn none, lost none, scored one, conceded none, win ratio 100%.\nSam Allardyce became England boss in July 2016 but only managed for one game - a late 1-0 away win against Slovakia in a World Cup qualifier.\nHe only lasted 67 days before he was dismissed. It followed a newspaper investigation claiming he offered advice on how to \"get around\" rules on player transfers.\nAn FA statement said Allardyce's conduct \"was inappropriate\" and he was gone.\nRoy Hodgson resigned after England's loss to Iceland at Euro 2016, although he would have been out of contract at the end of the tournament\nTournament record: Quarter-final at Euro 2012, group stage at 2014 World Cup, last 16 at Euro 2016.\nOverall record: Played 56, won 33, drawn 15, lost eight, scored 109, conceded 44, win ratio 58.9%.\nAfter Fabio Capello's resignation, Roy Hodgson was appointed just before Euro 2012 and he took England to the quarter-finals, where they lost on penalties to Italy.\nEngland remained unbeaten through qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, although they then failed to win a game in Brazil, suffering elimination after losing to Italy and Uruguay in their opening two matches.\nThe Three Lions won all 10 of their qualifying games to reach Euro 2016 but then suffered one of their most humiliating defeats, 2-1 to Iceland in the last 16, with Hodgson resigning after the game.\nExcluding Sam Allardyce's one game in charge and caretaker bosses, no England manager, including Sir Alf Ramsey, has a better winning percentage than Fabio Capello's 66.7% (28 wins from 42 matches)\nTournament record: Last 16 at 2010 World Cup, qualified for Euro 2012.\nOverall record: Played 42, won 28, drawn eight, lost six, scored 89, conceded 35, win ratio 66.7%.\nItalian Fabio Capello, who had successful spells in charge in AC Milan, Real Madrid, Roma and Juventus, became only the second non-British candidate to manage England when he was given the job in December 2007.\nEngland cruised through qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, securing their spot with two games to spare after eight successive victories.\nHowever, they struggled through as group runners-up, after drawing with the United States and Algeria, and were then beaten 4-1 by Germany in the last 16.\nEngland again impressed in qualifying for Euro 2012, but Capello resigned in the February before the finals, less than a week after John Terry had been stripped of the captaincy by the Football Association, with Capello disagreeing with the decision.\nSteve McClaren only lasted 18 matches in charge before he was dismissed\nTournament record: Did not qualify for Euro 2008.\nOverall record: Played 18, won nine, drawn four, lost five, scored 32, conceded 12, win ratio 50%.\nSteve McClaren was named as England manager in May 2006, having taken Middlesbrough to the Uefa Cup final, where they were then thrashed 4-0 by Sevilla.\nIn Euro 2008 qualifying, England struggled with draws against Macedonia and Israel, but only needed one point from their final two matches to qualify.\nHowever, McClaren's side lost 2-1 away to Russia and then 3-2 to Croatia on a wet November night at Wembley to miss out, with McClaren sacked the next day.\nEngland lost on penalties to Portugal in the quarter-finals at both Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup\nTournament record: Quarter-final at 2002 World Cup, quarter-final at Euro 2004, quarter-final at 2006 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 67, won 40, drawn 17, lost 10, scored 128, conceded 61, win ratio 59.7%.\nSweden's Sven-Goran Eriksson became the first non-British manager of the England team, taking over in January 2001.\nAn excellent 5-1 away win in Germany gave England a chance of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, which they did thanks to a dramatic 2-2 draw with Greece, with David Beckham scoring a 93rd-minute equaliser.\nEriksson guided England to three tournaments, but they went out in the quarter-finals in 2002, Euro 2004 and then the 2006 World Cup.\nIn 2002, they were beaten 2-1 by Brazil and in the other two competitions were eliminated on penalties by Portugal. The 2006 World Cup was always going to be Eriksson's last in charge of England after he announced five months earlier that he would leave the job when the tournament finished.\nKevin Keegan was twice named as European Footballer of the Year and played 63 times for England\nTournament record: Group stage at Euro 2000.\nOverall record: Played 18, won seven, drawn seven, lost four, scored 26, conceded 15, win ratio 38.9%.\nKevin Keegan was named England manager in February 1999 - they finished well behind Sweden in their qualification group for Euro 2000, but edged past Scotland 2-1 on aggregate in a two-legged play-off to qualify.\nEngland threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to Portugal in their opener and led twice before losing 3-2 to Romania, a result that eliminated Keegan's team in the group phase.\nIn their first qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup - also the last match at Wembley before its redevelopment - England lost 1-0 at home to Germany, with Keegan resigning immediately afterwards.\nGlenn Hoddle played for England on 53 occasions during his playing career\nTournament record: Last 16 at the 1998 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 28, won 17, drawn six, lost five, scored 42, conceded 13, win ratio 60.7%.\nGlenn Hoddle took over after Euro 1996 and faced a tough qualifying group for the 1998 World Cup. England lost 1-0 at home to Italy, but fought back and an excellent 0-0 away draw in the final group match in Rome secured a place at France 1998.\nEngland finished second in their group - beating Tunisia, losing to Romania and defeating Colombia - setting up a last-16 match with Argentina. Michael Owen scored an excellent goal to put England 2-1 ahead, but Beckham was sent off as the game went to penalties, with Argentina winning 4-3.\nHoddle was sacked in February 1999 following comments he was reported to have made in a newspaper interview about people with disabilities.\nTerry Venables knew he would only manage England at one tournament as Glenn Hoddle was named his successor before Euro 1996 had started\nTournament record: Semi-final at Euro 1996.\nOverall record: Played 24, won 11, drawn 11, lost two, scored 35, conceded 14, win ratio 45.8%.\nTerry Venables became England manager in January 1994 and did not have to play any qualifying matches for Euro 1996, with England as hosts.\nEngland began with a draw with Switzerland followed by a 2-0 win over Scotland and then an impressive 4-1 victory over the Netherlands. They edged past Spain on penalties in the quarter-finals and hopes were high of winning the tournament.\nBut England lost to Germany on spot kicks in the semi-finals, with Southgate missing the decisive penalty.\nGraham Taylor became England manager just after he had guided Aston Villa to second place in the old First Division in 1990\nTournament record: Group stage at Euro 1992, did not qualify for 1994 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 38, won 18, drawn 13, lost seven, scored 62, conceded 32, win ratio 47.4%.\nGraham Taylor came in after the 1990 World Cup and England qualified for Euro 1992 as group winners, despite only scoring seven goals in six matches.\nBut England finished bottom of the group at the tournament, drawing with Denmark and France and losing to Sweden.\nThere followed a disastrous qualifying campaign for the 1994 World Cup, England losing to Norway and the Netherlands as they finished third to miss out on the tournament. In Taylor's last game in charge, England went a goal behind inside nine seconds against San Marino and, despite winning 7-1, the manager was sacked less than a week later.\nBobby Robson won the FA Cup in 1978 and the Uefa Cup in 1981 with Ipswich Town before becoming England manager\nTournament record: Did not qualify for Euro 1984, quarter-final at 1986 World Cup, group stage at Euro 1988, fourth at 1990 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 95, won 47, drawn 30, lost 18, scored 154, conceded 60, win ratio 49.5%.\nJust as Sir Alf Ramsey had done in the 1960s, Sir Bobby Robson became England manager following great success at Ipswich Town, with Robson getting the national job shortly after England were knocked out of the 1982 World Cup.\nIt was a tough start as England failed to qualify for Euro 1984, coming second behind group winners Denmark. But Robson's side reached the quarter-finals at the 1986 World Cup, losing 2-1 to Argentina, with Diego Maradona scoring twice, including his infamous 'Hand of God' goal, when he punched the ball into the net.\nEngland lost all three games at Euro 1988, but then, for the first time since 1966, reached the semi-finals of a major tournament, before losing on penalties to West Germany in the last four at Italia 90.\nRon Greenwood guided West Ham to the FA Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup in the 1960s\nTournament record: Did not qualify for 1978 World Cup, group stage of Euro 1980, second group stage of 1982 World Cup.\nOverall record: Played 55, won 33, drawn 12, lost 10, scored 93, conceded 40, win ratio 60%.\nRon Greenwood became England manager in August 1977 and despite two 2-0 wins in their final qualifiers, against Luxembourg and Italy, it was not enough to get the team to the 1978 World Cup, with England missing out on goal difference.\nEngland were unbeaten in qualifying for Euro 1980, where they finished third out of four teams in their group and failed to make the final.\nThey won all three matches in the first group phase at the 1982 World Cup, but two 0-0 draws in the second group phase, against West Germany and Spain, ended England's tournament and Greenwood's time in charge.\nDon Revie scored four goals in six England appearances in the 1950s and had great success as Leeds manager, with his trophies including two league titles, the FA Cup, League Cup and two European competitions\nTournament record: Did not qualify for Euro 1976.\nOverall record: Played 29, won 14, drawn eight, lost seven, scored 49, conceded 25, win ratio 48.3%.\nIn July 1974, Don Revie accepted the job of England manager after Sir Alf Ramsey had been sacked two months earlier.\nRevie, a hugely successful manager with Leeds United, failed to take England to Euro 1976, although only four nations qualified for the later stages. England needed to win their qualifying group, but a loss to Czechoslovakia and a draw with Portugal left them second.\nAfter four of six qualifying games for the 1978 World Cup, Revie announced, via an interview with the Daily Mail, that he was to leave the England role and had accepted a lucrative offer to become the manager of the United Arab Emirates' side.\nUse the form below to rank your favourite England managers and share your results after you've completed it."

We didn't really get to grips with any part of the game.

So there is a lot of work to be done.\"\nNaismith believes too many of the current squad are \"scared\" of taking responsibility in games Rangers are expected to win, and any increase in budget from a takeover should be invested in changing the profile of the squad.\n\"The investment side of it has to come and be put into players that are ready-made to deal with the pressure and have leadership and a mentality of winning.\n\"That, for me, is the thing that's been missing.\""

If I start picking the team based on what is said on social media then that will be going away from our main principles.\"\nAkins was a Mansfield player when the crash happened three years ago and has remained available to play throughout that time.\nMr Daniel, 33, died 10 days after he was struck by Akins' Mercedes car in Huddersfield in March 2022.\nAkins is due back at Leeds Crown Court for sentencing on 24 April.\nAkins plays for Mansfield hours after death crash guilty plea\nFootballer admits causing cyclist's crash death\nWhile the forward featured against Wigan on the same day that he entered his guilty plea, Akins' involvement in the game lasted just 45 minutes because of a hamstring injury.\nHe was not included in the squad that drew 1-1 with Stevenage on Saturday.\nClough was asked about how \"mentally difficult\" the situation has been for the player and club to deal with ahead of Tuesday's League One game at Exeter City.\n\"It's incredibly difficult, but he has been dealing with it for the last two or three years and all we can do is give him every bit of support we can,\" Clough said.\nAkins, who has six international caps for Grenada and counts Burton Albion and Huddersfield Town among the eight clubs he has played for during his near 18-year professional career, is into the final four months of the year-long contract extension he signed with Mansfield last summer."

        "title": "Five ways a new format has transformed the Champions League",
        "content": "This video can not be played\nA 'new era' of the Champions League - all you need to know\nThe revamped Champions League's new league phase reached a thrilling climax on Wednesday night - and what an evening we had.\nManchester City looked like they were heading out of the competition altogether at half-time in their match against Club Brugge.\nMeanwhile, Aston Villa were in a real scrap against Celtic before they secured a spot in the coveted top-eight places and an automatic spot in the last 16.\nWith the play-offs next, BBC Sport looks at what has worked, what hasn't, and how Uefa's top club tournament has shaped up so far.\nGoing into the final group games last term, 13 teams had already secured qualification for the last 16.\nBut this season, only Liverpool and Barcelona were guaranteed a place in the last 16 - gained by finishing in the top eight places in the league.\nSo with 27 teams still having something on the line an exciting finale to the league phase was anticipated.\nAnd it lived up to its billing, with City one of the big stories, as they came from behind to win 3-1, and avoid an embarrassing early exit, less than two years on from being crowned European champions.\nElsewhere, Barcelona missed the chance to finish top after being held by Atalanta, and record 15-time winners Real Madrid were only able to finish 11th.\nAC Milan were reduced to 10 men as their hopes of a place in the top eight were dashed by a Dinamo Zagreb side fighting, but ultimately failing, to reach the play-offs.\n\"This new format, people are split. It is brilliant, isn't it? We have gone down to the wire,\" said former Celtic and Blackburn forward Chris Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nFormer England goalkeeper Joe Hart, added:  \"It was their [Uefa's] dream on Wednesday night. Everything on the line, someone like Manchester City were on the edge of being eliminated.\n\"For them to be potentially going out of the competition brings that interest for the next round, the play-off.\"\nBy creating a format where teams played eight different opponents in a league stage that culminated with 64 goals in the final 18 matches, Uefa decision-makers will perhaps feel they succeeded in removing feelings of the early stages being repetitive at times.\nAnd speaking on TNT Sports, former Scotland and Rangers striker Ally McCoist, added: \"It was a little bit chaotic at times because there were goals going in everywhere.\n\"I don't think I would be able to watch just the one game in my house, on my sofa, ever again. It was sensational.\"\nTo counter that argument, the old group stage offered home and away matches against three opponents, with the rivalry that could deliver.\nUefa's hopes of ensuring every game counted in this format has largely been met, but its stated aim of a loss or win in the final match making the difference between reaching the last 16 or being eliminated did not come to fruition.\nYoung Boys and Slovan Bratislava were resigned to their fate for some time prior to Wednesday, having lost their first seven games.\nBologna, Sparta Prague, Leipzig, Girona, Red Star Belgrade, Sturm Graz and Salzburg also found themselves without anything to play for and, unlike in previous years, there is no consolation prize of Europa League football for anyone leaving the Champions League.\nBy the time the league phase ended 144 matches had taken place as opposed to the 96 played 12 months ago.\nAnd despite the inclusion of four extra sides and 48 more fixtures, just 12 clubs have actually dropped out.\nWith another 16 games in a play-off knockout round to follow, some argue it feels like a long and drawn out process to get to the business end of the competition.\n\"No matter what happened, you are still going to have the big hitters later on in the competition,\" added former Liverpool and Aston Villa defender Stephen Warnock on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nFormer England midfielder Izzy Christiansen added: \"I'm not sold on this new format yet. I need a season to get my head around it, to feel it out and make my judgement.\n\"There are pros and cons. I am a sucker for the old format I watched growing up, the groups of four, the home and away games, going into the round of 16, quarter-finals and so on.\"\nIn the event of a team competing in the play-offs going on to win the Champions League, they will have played 17 main-draw games in total, up four from last season.\nLast season's finalists Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund did not finish in the top eight\nIn a repeat of the 2023 final, City hosted Inter Milan in the opening round of fixtures in September, while AC Milan welcomed Liverpool.\nReal Madrid, Juventus, Barca, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Arsenal and Villa were also involved in plenty of glamourous matches.\nAnd it is difficult to remember many, aside from City against Inter, that did not deliver drama, a bucket load of goals, or both.\nWhile Real thrashed Dortmund 5-2 in a repeat of their meeting at Wembley last June, they also lost 2-0 and 3-1 to Liverpool and Milan respectively.\nBarca came out the right side of nine-goal and five-goal thrillers against Benfica and Dortmund, while also defeating Bayern 4-1, and 13 goals were scored in City's defeats by Sporting, Juventus and PSG.\nWith more games overall, there are also more opportunities for individuals to make their mark.\nStars like Erling Haaland (47 goals in his Champions League career) and Kylian Mbappe (51 goals), will aim to close in on milestones set over a long period by the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo - the competition's all-time leading scorer with 141 goals - and Lionel Messi (129 goals).\nThe new system was also meant to offer a greater competitive balance between all the teams, with the possibility for each to play opponents of a similar level throughout the league phase.\nBut that in itself presented several contradictions, as did the seedings.\nVilla's victory over Bayern came at a time when they were just four points off the top of the Premier League.\nIt presented the case that some pot-four sides were perhaps just as strong as clubs two gradings above them.\nYet others like pot three's Young Boys, who are perennial strugglers in the competition and toiling domestically in Switzerland this season, could make a compelling argument that their fixture list offered far sterner tests than others faced. Inter Milan, Barcelona and Atalanta were among their opposition.\nPast editions of the tournament would also have provided Dinamo Zagreb, for example, with the opportunity to avenge their 9-2 humbling at Bayern Munich on home soil.\nThere is also something odd about a league in which the number of points scored is used to rank sides despite clubs only encountering 20% of their potential opponents.\nAdding two fixtures per club to this stage of the competition delivers more revenue for Uefa and participating teams.\nHowever, it also means fitting more games in an already-congested schedule and an increase in the carbon footprint involved in getting to them.\nFans also face extra travel costs, when ticket price increases are also a hot topic across the game, with Villa defending their pricing after a backlash from supporters earlier in the campaign.\nThe expansion of the Champions League has also arrived during a period in which a 32-team Club World Cup competition has been bolted on to the calendar this summer.\nGlobal players union Fifpro, which is part of a legal action against world governing body Fifa, has published a report raising its concerns around player welfare, while a number of stars, like Spain and Manchester City midfielder Rodri, have said players are close to striking over excessive demands being placed on them.\nFormer Arsenal and France forward Thierry Henry and ex-Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher have expressed the view, external that modern-day players are being \"being treated like cattle\" and \"run into the ground\".\nLatest Champions League table\nChampions League scores & fixtures\nFollow the latest Champions League news\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00."

        "content": "Fraser Forster spoke to Spurs' injured number one Guglielmo Vicario afterwards\n\"Has there been a worse performance from two goalkeepers in the same game ever?\"\nThat was the question posed by former Liverpool defender and Sky pundit Jamie Carragher after Tottenham's Carabao Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United.\nIt was a match in which United's expected goals (xG) was 2.38 and actual goals were three - and Tottenham scored four goals from just 0.67 xG.\nThe keepers in question were second-choices Altay Bayindir of Manchester United and Fraser Forster of Tottenham.\nThey were each directly responsible for two goals, while one shot which didn't actually end up in the net was kept out by a save which had commentators literally laughing out loud.\nSo what happened?\nDominic Solanke gave Spurs the lead from the first mistake\nIt felt like the story of the game was going to be something else entirely after Tottenham took a 3-0 lead.\nThe first goal saw Bayindir, given a chance in the cup over usual number one Andre Onana, parry Pedro Porro's 25-yard shot straight to Dominic Solanke to slot in.\n\"The goalkeeper has to push that wide, he cannot push that back into the danger zone,\" said ex-United captain Gary Neville on Sky Sports.\n\"You could argue the United defenders are sleeping, but as a keeper you have got to make sure that goes out.\"\nDejan Kulusevski and Solanke again seemingly put Tottenham in control.\nFraser Forster could only watch on as Joshua Zirkzee tapped in after he had given the ball away\nBut 36-year-old Forster, deputising in recent weeks for the injured Guglielmo Vicario, took centre stage.\nMoments after making an outstanding save to keep out Joshua Zirkzee's header, he was caught out by the United striker.\nForster received a pass from Archie Gray and under some pressure from Zirkzee, passed the ball straight to United captain Bruno Fernandes.\nFernandes picked out Zirkzee via a deflection and it was an easy finish for 3-1.\n\"He is not amazing with the ball at his feet, Fraser Forster, but he hasn't even looked where Bruno Fernandes is,\" said Neville.\n\"He is not aware at all.\"\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Michael Brown, watching for BBC Radio 5 Live, said: \"He gets given a difficult ball but then he tries to be too calm and cool.\n\"He plays it right to Fernandes, it's an awful mistake from the goalkeeper. Just take a touch, clear it away.\"\nForster Forster was at fault again when Amad Diallo closed him down to make it 3-2\nIt got worse seven minutes later. Forster again received a backpass from Gray, took too long on the ball and as Amad Diallo slid in Forster's attempted clearance ricocheted back into the goal.\nThat was 3-2.\n\"Ange Postecoglou is looking down to the ground in shock and disbelief,\" said Brown.\n\"Forster takes far too long. Diallo just slides in and takes a risk, and because of the poor tempo of the goalkeeper he gets in front of it and the ball flies into the net. You can't make mistakes like that at this level.\"\nNeville added: \"This is one of the most Tottenham things you will see. Oh Fraser, he thinks he has time and an age.\n\"But Amad closes down with unbelievable tenacity and he goes for it.\"\n'Are you not entertained?' - Spurs survive chaos to keep cup dream alive\nTottenham edge past Man Utd in remarkable EFL Cup quarter-final\nThose two United goals sparked a panicky spell from both Spurs and Forster.\nAs the visitors piled forward in search of an equaliser, Diallo took aim with a speculative shot from distance that was heading straight at the ex-England keeper.\nInstead of getting down to keep the ball out with his hands, however, Forster booted it away with his feet like a defender clearing off his own line.\nIn Forster's defence, Carragher said afterwards it was a good save because the 6ft 7in keeper would not have been able to get down in time.\n\"We all burst out laughing, but there's no way he could've got his hands down so quickly,\" he said.\nAt the time, Neville was less forgiving.\n\"It's like when an outfield player goes in net at the end of training,\" he said on co-commentary. \"They don't want to break their hands so they just whack it clear.\"\nThe chaotic series of events led to United's players standing on the edge of the Spurs box ready to charge in if Forster took it short - which he did once - while home fans cheered when he went long another time.\nAltay Bayindir claimed he was fouled for Tottenham's fourth goal\nIt really felt at that stage as if United were going to score an equaliser.\nBut Son Heung-min's corner flew straight over the head of Bayindir, who tried and failed to punch it away, and into the back of the net to put Spurs 4-2 up.\nThe Turkey international insisted he was fouled by Tottenham's Lucas Bergvall, who touched his arm, but the referee disagreed and the goal stood.\n\"There is a slight arm on his left arm, that's what he's asking for,\" said BBC pundit Brown.\n\"But ironically he goes to punch it with his right arm and misses the ball. He should easily take that, no danger at all.\"\nThere was still time for one more goal with United sub Jonny Evans heading past Forster at the near post. He could have saved it perhaps, but it ranked low on the list of things goalkeepers should have done better in the game.\nAltay Bayindir (next to Andre Onana) continued his complaints afterwards\nAfter the game Bayindir continued to argue with the officials with Onana next to him. The Cameroonian will not be worried about losing his place on the back of this performance.\nLikewise, usual Spurs number one Vicario, on crutches, spoke to Forster, who has started the past seven games.\nTottenham boss Ange Postecoglou told Sky Sports: \"The first one affected Fraser and then the second one came as a result of that.\"\nLater, speaking generally, he said: \"It's part of football, mistakes will happen.\n\"You're asking for perfection in human beings and that doesn't exist. Sometimes they stuff up just like I do and you do.\"\nThe Australian was asked again about the goalkeeper in his post-match news conference.\n\"He is disappointed because he was outstanding for us. Even with his feet, he found some great solutions,\" he said.\nAmorim, meanwhile, did not attribute any blame to Bayindir, who was making only his fourth appearance in 18 months for the club.\nThis video can not be played\nPostecoglou says League Cup win was 'tighter than it should have been'\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

        "title": "'Dedicated' Ten Hag planned to be at United 10 years â McCarthy",
        "content": "Erik ten Hag added Benni McCarthy to his Manchester United coaching team in July 2022\nFormer Blackburn and South Africa striker Benni McCarthy has revealed Erik ten Hag wanted to be Manchester United manager for a decade, describing his former boss as an \"unbelievable professional\".\nMcCarthy, 47, who was appointed as Kenya's new head coach this week, worked as a first-team coach under the Dutchman for two seasons.\nTen Hag, who took charge at Old Trafford in April 2022, was sacked by United in October.\n\"I was given an incredible opportunity to work with one of the biggest and best clubs in the world under the guidance of Erik ten Hag,\" McCarthy told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"I learned utmost professionalism because the manager I worked under was not just a disciplinarian, but he was the best and one of the most unbelievable professionals I've ever seen in the game.\n\"Extremely hard-working, very dedicated, very passionate, he planned on being the Manchester United coach for the next 10 years. That was his vision.\"\nDespite the premature end to Ten Hag's reign, the pair did enjoy success during their time working together at the club.\nUnited collected two domestic cup titles, while the poaching know-how in front of goal of McCarthy - who is South Africa's all-time leading goal-scorer with 31 - helped Marcus Rashford enjoy his most prolific season, finding the net 30 times during the 2022-23 campaign.\n\"Everyone is talking about how bad, how terrible Manchester United is,\" added McCarthy.\n\"We still managed to win the FA Cup, we still managed to win the Carabao Cup. I was proud that I was part of that regime.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBenni McCarthy spent two seasons at Old Trafford coaching attacking talent like Cristiano Ronaldo\nMcCarthy's time at United came to an end in June with the expiration of his two-year contract.\nAs a player, the South African enjoyed a successful career in Europe, which included a six-season spell in the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers and West Ham.\nHe also played for Ajax and Celta Vigo, and was a Champions League winner at Porto under the tutelage of Jose Mourinho.\nHaving moved into coaching, the self-declared Manchester United fan was delighted to find himself part of Ten Hag's backroom team.\n\"History just smacks you in the face, because it's the most iconic football club in the world,\" he said of his time in Manchester.\n\"To have been part and parcel of that history was second to none. I was proud of being an African and having that opportunity.\"\nHowever, the former striker remains at a loss to explain the inability of numerous big-name coaches to arrest United's slow decline since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013.\n\"Honest to god, I don't know what the issue is,\" McCarthy admitted.\n\"It is just such a huge football club and the problems just seem to go on and on - and I don't know how they're going to resolve it.\n\"I've always been a fan - I love the club. It's sad, and I just hope that the management, and the especially the coach, can rally the players, because they are very good players.\"\nMcCarthy's Man Utd role to 'inspire South Africans'\nThings have not got any better for United since the departures of Ten Hag and McCarthy and the appointment of Ruben Amorim at the beginning of November.\nThe club is currently on course to record its lowest ever Premier League points total, and Amorim even went as far as describing his side as \"the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United\" in January.\nThe Portuguese has lost 10 of his 25 games in charge, while United's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney recently described him as \"naive\".\nHowever, McCarthy retains hope Amorim can turn things around.\n\"He's clever. He's a smart coach. He's young,\" he explained.\n\"He might not have all the answers, but I think he's got a good philosophy. He's got a team behind him, that supports him very well, that he brought with him.\"\nSince Ferguson vacated the Old Trafford hot-seat after 27 years in charge, United have recruited six full-time managers, as well as four different caretakers - a lack of stability that McCarthy has found uncomfortable.\nBut as he looks to prosper in his own leading role with Kenya, the South African will still be watching United with keen interest, hoping to employ a very Ferguson-esque way of toasting success.\n\"I want him [Amorim] to succeed. I want him to win things so that we can enjoy our weekends, have a glass of wine and chill, relax, because you know your team is going to do the business,\" he said.\nI won't get time Arteta had at Arsenal - Amorim\nFewer goals than Antony and January regrets - the problems facing Amorim"

Slot\nWhich teams are through in Champions League - and who plays who next?\nLiverpool head coach Slot gave Nunez the hard word recently when he said he \"can't accept\" his work-rate in games at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers and at Aston Villa.\nThere was no question about his work-rate here, but this was a confused, over-anxious display characterised by misplaced passes and misunderstandings after he replaced Diogo Jota with 17 minutes left of normal time.\nIf anything, this was the work of someone trying too hard.\nIt will, however, only increase the question marks about whether it will ever fall into place for a striker who earned a reputation as \"Captain Chaos\" for his all-action style but simply does not produce with the consistency to meet Liverpool's demands.\nNunez, it should be stressed, was certainly not to blame for Liverpool's loss and the greats can miss penalties, but it was his miss that felt as it if carried more weight.\nHe is likely to have plenty of chances to turn his fortunes around, perhaps starting against Newcastle United in Sunday's Carabao Cup final, but there is an inescapable sense that his future is likely to be on the agenda in the summer when Slot's tenure moves into its next phase, almost certainly with a Premier League title to defend.\nThis was a tough night in all respects for Liverpool, who will certainly question the luck of the Champions League draw after topping the new format's table with ease only to draw a PSG side who can now be considered potential winners, such is their quality.\nIf Liverpool rode their luck to somehow escape with a 1-0 win in the first leg in Paris, they did not enjoy the best of fortune here as both Alexander-Arnold, injured and now a doubt to face Newcastle United at Wembley, and Jarrel Quansah hit the woodwork.\nDonnarumma also saved well from Ibrahima Konate and Luis Diaz, while Mohamed Salah had a rare night when the final flourish eluded him.\nLiverpool's luck did not even hold for the toss for penalties, the kicks being taken in front of PSG's fans at the Anfield Road end rather than in front of the Kop, who were forced to try and inspire from afar.\nThis was the first time Liverpool had gone out at Anfield after winning the first leg of a European tie, while it was also the first time they had lost a penalty shootout in this competition after winning the European Cup against Roma in Rome in 1984, the Champions League against AC Milan in 2005 then beating Chelsea in the semi-final in 2007.\nPSG will say, with some justification, they deserved their win over two legs and coach Luis Enrique, a Champions League winner with Barcelona, is presiding over a superb revamp of a team that looks more cohesive and energetic than the one that failed so often in the Champions League.\nThe \"Bling Bling\" era of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar has gone, to be replaced by Ousmane Dembele finally fulfilling his potential and recent signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia adding a new dimension.\nThis is a team that will threaten every opponent.\nThis video can not be played\nI hope fans didn't want 'incredible' game to stop- Slot\nFor Liverpool, this is a bitter disappointment among all their imperious Premier League progress this season.\nTalk of a quadruple was always fanciful, but the FA Cup campaign ended when Slot fielded a virtual reserve side at the Championship's bottom club Plymouth Argyle, while an exit at the last-16 stage always counts as a Champions League failure for a club of Liverpool's aspirations.\nThis season still has so much to offer for Liverpool and Slot, as they stand 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League, their coronation now little more than a formality as their rivals fall by the wayside in the face of their relentless consistency.\nIt has been a superb campaign.\nThe Champions League, however, always adds that extra touch of spice and glamour to the latter stages of any Liverpool season and there was no disguising the pain of defeat on the faces of their players and Slot when Desire Doue slammed home the penalty that confirmed PSG's place in the quarter-finals, where they will face either Aston Villa, who hold a 3-1 lead from the first leg, or Club Brugge.\nLiverpool have the perfect opportunity to recover from this disappointment with a Wembley final against Newcastle on Sunday - but there is no escaping this was a night of huge disappointment for a side touted by so many as the best side in Europe and Champions League favourites.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone"

        "title": "Discipline, injuries & family - how Dembele turned career around",
        "content": "Ousmane Dembele has long had a big reputation.\nThe forward - who was once the second-most expensive player in history when he signed for Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund in 2017 in a deal worth Â£135.5m - was described by Barca president Joan Laporta as \"better than Kylian Mbappe\" in 2021.\nA week later, then-new Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez said he was a player who, \"when used properly, could be the best player in the world\".\nTwo months on, having been told by a cash-strapped Barcelona to accept a new contract on reduced terms or leave, Xavi dropped him from the squad.\nThat story reflects his time at Barcelona, a six-year spell of inconsistency and unfulfilled potential.\nIn August 2023, the France international was bought by Paris St-Germain for just Â£43.5m, having scored 40 goals in 185 games and won three La Liga titles.\nNow - with 10 goals in his past five games - he is currently Europe's most in-form striker, drawing comparison to the likes of Lionel Messi, who scored 13 goals in four games in March 2012, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who hit 11 goals in four games in May 2011.\nHe is also being seen as PSG's trump card in their quest for a first Champions League trophy.\nThe 27-year-old has scored 18 goals in his past 11 appearances for PSG in all competitions and since the start of December, has scored more goals (18) than any other player in the big five European leagues.\nSo, as PSG go into Wednesday's Champions League play-off second leg against Brest with a 3-0 lead, what has changed and can his remarkable form last?\nOusmane Dembele joined PSG for Â£43.5m from Barcelona in August 2023\nDembele arrived at Barcelona aged 20 as their most expensive signing, but his time at the club was a mix of injury setbacks and off-field issues.\nDespite being largely injury-free at Rennes and Dortmund, he sustained 14 muscle injuries at the Nou Camp, spending 784 days sidelined.\nConcerns over discipline and professionalism led the club to assign private chefs to him, while late nights because of gaming affected his training punctuality, making him the club's most-fined player in recent years.\nStill, when fit, his explosive pace and dribbling made him a game-changer, as he showed glimpses of the talent Barcelona invested in.\nSo what changed him?\nThose that know him best - and few do - say he changed after marrying his girlfriend Rima at a Muslim wedding in Morocco in December 2021, and soon after he had a child.\nThe wedding came as a surprise to many of his team-mates, not least because they did not even know he had a partner.\nSo the big changes to his life occurred in his last two seasons at Barcelona when, essentially, he grew up.\nHe worked at home with a physiotherapist and frequently went to France to receive specialised preventative treatments. With the eyes and mind of a father, he began to see things differently.\nHe finally took on board the importance of good nutrition and, for the past few seasons, has employed a French nutritionist who has helped him maintain a healthier lifestyle.\nDembele always enjoyed the respect and esteem of his Barca team-mates, many of whom were surprised and disappointed to see him sold to PSG.\nDembele has never lacked confidence, is super-passionate about football and arrived in Paris in August 2023 convinced of his ability to star and succeed at the club, despite the presence at the time of Mbappe.\nLast summer, manager Luis Enrique told Dembele that, without Mbappe in the team, he needed more goals from him to go with his large number of assists - carte blanche for the player to show a more selfish approach with less passing and a bigger desire to score.\nIn private, the coaching staff have frequently told him that if he managed to convert a decent percentage of the chances that he creates, it can lead to collective success and then individual honours. The Ballon d'Or even.\nHe has taken it all on board and is relishing playing in his new tactical role.\nLast season, he was mostly played on the right. Now he operates as a false nine, inside, where he touches the ball more, enjoys a greater freedom to receive passes and participate in the build-up but with more chances to finish.\nHe is enjoying talking about tactics, about how to improve and about understanding the game. He is now the complete opposite of how he was perceived by many at Barcelona.\nAnd the goals have flowed. His tally of 23 coming from all angles.\nThis season, he has scored 16 in Ligue 1 (eight with his right foot, six with the left, two headers), six in the Champions League (four right, two left) and one left-footed goal in the Nations League.\nIt has not all been smooth sailing for Dembele in Paris though. Despite his quiet facade, he still has fire inside.\nIn September, following PSG's 3-1 victory over Rennes, there was a heated exchange between player and manager - leading to Dembele's exclusion from the squad for a subsequent Champions League match against Arsenal.\nLuis Enrique emphasised the importance of players fulfilling their responsibilities to the team, saying: \"When a player doesn't meet their obligations, this is the sort of thing that can happen.\n\"The best thing I did was not to play him in London against Arsenal, even though that was heavily criticised. This is my best decision of the year. He did the rest himself.\"\nDembele did not like the way he had been talked to by the manager in front of the squad and overreacted. Soon after he apologised.\nHe was also sent off against Bayern Munich and after that, spending two games on the bench, it was incorrectly suggested that Luis Enrique had punished him.\nHe was actually rested because the coach thought he was a bit unfocused and needed a mental rest. Those two games were two unexpected draws against Nantes and Auxerre.\nThis week we saw a video of training with the two men hugging and laughing.\nLuis Enrique was also full of praise for Demble after he scored twice in the first-leg win against Brest.\n\"Ask him what he has had for breakfast since Christmas! Actually those who see him regularly are not surprised,\" he said.\nFor some time many have believed that the holy grail of a Champions League triumph for PSG might be dependent on the on-field achievements of one of France's heroes.\nThat could still be the case - just not with Mbappe, but a rejuvenated Dembele.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast"

But [women's] football was banned in England for 50 years... there is still a lot of making up to do.\n\"We think about the previous generations who were trailblazers and never got the rewards. We've enjoyed the fruits of that and hopefully for the next generation the progress will be a step further still.\"\nHayley Ladd joined Everton for an undisclosed fee in January 2025\nLadd moved to Manchester United in 2019 and spent six years with the club, winning the FA Cup - United women's first major trophy - and playing more than 100 games for the Red Devils.\nHowever, Ladd had been a peripheral figure this season, playing only 10 minutes of WSL action before a January transfer window move to Everton.\nHaving been a senior player at United, Ladd says opting for the switch to Merseyside was not easy, with Wales and her desire to be in peak condition for this summer's European Championship big factors in her decision.\n\"I always tried to be the best team-mate that I could be and try to push standards and advocate for the women's team as much as possible at United,\" she said.\n\"That was something in terms of my integrity and how I could keep going each day knowing I was trying to do the best thing possible, for not only myself but my team-mates too, even when I wasn't playing as much as I would have liked.\n\"I'm filled with pride to know that, hopefully, I've had a lasting impact at the club.\n\"I feel really proud to have made the move to Everton. I feel incredibly happy to be with the club, and it felt like a bandage I had to rip off in terms of leaving Manchester United.\"\nAnd the key reason behind the move?\n\"I hope it sets me up well to play for Wales and my performances can reflect that,\" she added.\nThis video can not be played\nWales' Euro play-off bigger than my FA Cup finals - Hayley Ladd\nFor Ladd, the pride of the individual success of winning 100 caps will be put into the shade by the thought of featuring at Euro 2025, particularly after the pivotal role she played in qualifying for the Switzerland tournament.\nLadd and Wales' defenders were star performers as Wilkinson's team shocked the Republic of Ireland in December's play-off final, with a 2-1 second leg win in Dublin enough to secure a 3-2 aggregate victory.\nSuddenly, Ladd's career-long dream had become a reality.\nYou would have forgiven Wales' senior players for starting to wonder if major tournament qualification would ever happen, after the heartache of near misses in their attempts to reach the previous three major finals.\n\"I think we had this feeling that this time we were not going to go down without a fight, I think we felt like it was going to be our time, that we were going to get over the line this time,\" Ladd said.\n\"To finally get there after all that heartbreak, and when I say that - heartbreak - I really mean it, to finally get there was just the best feeling.\n\"In terms of my career it is the absolute highlight, without a doubt. It all led us to where we are now.\n\"Things are a world apart from where we were 99 caps ago. In one sense it feels like a blink of an eye, but there has been so much change in women's football. Long may that continue.\""

Yes, we can play better, but who cares? The treble is still on. Enjoy these days, it has not always been like this. The last 25 years have been incredible domestically.\nJohn: The victory was very comfortable. Hibs never gave up, but on the day, Celtic were just too good for them.\nChris: I think we did what we needed to do. We had good spells in the game, got the goals at the right time, defended well and controlled the game when we needed. To me, it was another example of maybe not firing on all cylinders but you get the result anyway - and against a much-improved Hibs side.\nBrian: Maeda is just like a Celtic Mo Salah! He scores every other match: league, League Cup, Champions League, Scottish Cup. Unstoppable. Player of last month, year and Ballon d'Or!\nHibs took 7,000 fans to Glasgow, but some were underwhelmed by their set-up...\nPeter: Disappointing result. I expected more of a hearty fight than this purely defensive performance. We offered nothing going forward. Too many players below par. David Gray should have made his subs earlier. Hibs fans were the best thing on a bad day at the office.\nKenny: A brave performance, but when we won the ball, we didn't keep it and that was the difference from the game at Easter Road. We didn't make many chances either and, of course, Celtic are very strong footballing side. We gave the ball away with some loose passing and you can't do that against Celtic.\nSandy: So unlucky with the early injury to Nicky Cadden, a hugely important player for Hibs. We held our own, though, and Jordan Smith proved why he was given the longer contract. He was superb. In the end, 2-0 was okay as we were running on empty, but we can definitely hold our heads high and focus on the league table now.\nScott: Celtic were sitting back latterly and playing on the counter, which in itself is a testament to how well Hibs played in the previous 80 minutes. Gray set Hibs up well and, if this tie had been in Edinburgh, there might well have been a different outcome. This team has plenty of guts and resilience for sure.\nNeville: Very disappointed with our approach. Sitting back and absorbing attack after attack seldom wins games. Think we had one shot on target. Not the way I want my team to play in these tough matches. Have a go.\nJohn: Celtic had to work hard for their goals, so respect to the defence and especially Smith. Unfortunately, a few players weren't at it but nonetheless gave everything. This hopefully is the start of good things at Easter Road.\nSome Aberdeen fans would like to see Kevin Nisbet stay at the club permanently after the on-loan Millwall striker scored his fifth goal in his past six outings\nAberdeen fans found plenty of positives after watching their side score four on their way into the semi-final draw.\nKarl: I believe playing alongside a clever front partner in Oday Dabbagh has really benefitted Kevin Nisbet. He's able to find space more easily and his confidence is flowing. I would be delighted if we could do a deal with Milwall to keep him.\nGary: Apart from a dodgy five-minute spell, we absolutely dominated the game. If we have any sense, we sign Nisbet now. Delighted for Graeme Shinnie also, he deserves all the adulation. There has been a lot of criticism of the management team, but Jimmy Thelin is getting the team and style he wants.\nDavid: Assured solid performance, no banana skin moments at all, roll on the semi-final.\nPaul: Feeling more positive suddenly for the rest of the season. Every game is a cup final from now on. Leighton Clarkson and Ante Palaversa ran the game and loving Shinnie back at left-back with his infectious enthusiasm. Onwards and upwards.\nDick: An assured performance from Aberdeen. They have found a structure in the team where they can control matches with Clarkson bossing the show. Nisbet is now on fire and Shayden Morris is too hot to handle. The next target is to be sure of reaching the top six.\nBen: It's only Queen's Park, but there was so much to like about that performance. For once, our attack looked threatening and it looked like the scoreline could have been five or six to us. At times, you could really feel that we were going to score, especially after Nisbet's opener. He played amazing. Let's take this performance into the league.\nSander Kartum opened the scoring at Tynecastle with a fabulous curling strike from distance\nHearts bounced back from their Edinburgh derby loss with an eye-catching win at Tynecastle.\nAnon: A far better display from Hearts. Lewis Nielson had a man of the match display. Subs made a difference also in second half when Dundee came back into the game. Another nine league games played like that should see us into a top-four spot.\nJim: Impressive win. Kartum looks a real find - tall, athletic, fast, skilful and scores good goals. With Cammy Devlin back soon alongside him, we are building an exciting midfield and, with options up front, it could be an interesting end of the season. The defence stills needs work, but it will be interesting to see how we do against Celtic away in two weeks.\nDavid: A fantastic cup tie, end-to-end stuff, two fantastic finishes from Kartum. Beni Baningime was magnificent - back to the player he was before the injury.\nPeter: Those two marvellous goals from Kartum reminded me of Rudi Skacel. If Kartum proves to be of Skacel's ilk, we could be in for a very interesting time.\nDundee fans, meanwhile, were critical of manager Tony Docherty.\nAlan: Docherty needs a reality check. Our defence has more holes than a sieve, our midfield is nowhere near physical enough to compete at this level, and going into a game like this with only two signed strikers (one injured) is an absolute disgrace. To survive a relegation dogfight you need grit and the ability to defend. We have neither.\nMark: Great following but let down as usual. Baffles me that the midfield sat too deep all game but not a soul in sight marking their player for the first and third goal on the edge of box. Tactics sit with Docherty, so his time is up.\nJim: Docherty keeps going on about second-half performances. We need them from the start - not half way through. Nine cup finals left in the league? We could be going down.\nBoab: Devastated that we're out, but Docherty must now get the team up for the derby and the remaining league games. Yet again, a superb backing from our fantastic support.\nLammy: Midfield overran again. Defence left exposed. Forwards left with no service. Has been the same story all season.\nKevin: Have always been a staunch supporter of Docherty, but I'm afraid my patience has run out. Nothing has been done to arrest the constant leaking of goals. We're not going to get anywhere while conceding two-plus goals every week. Far too weak in midfield and he doesn't seem capable of making any changes to make us harder to beat."

        "title": "'Some Man Utd players not good enough & overpaid'",
        "content": "This video can not be played\nSir Jim Ratcliffe names players Casemiro, Hojlund, Onana as 'inherited'\nSome Manchester United players are \"not good enough\" and some are \"overpaid\", the club's co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe says.\nMidfielder Casemiro, striker Rasmus Hojlund, goalkeeper Andre Onana, and wingers Antony and Jadon Sancho - who are on loan at other clubs - were namechecked by the billionaire in an interview with BBC Sport as players his regime had \"inherited\".\nRatcliffe, a lifelong Manchester United fan, is the chairman of petrochemicals company Ineos, which has a strong sport investment arm.\nThe 72-year-old last year spent Â£1.3bn for a 28.94% stake in the club in a deal which saw Ineos take control of football operations.\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Ratcliffe addressed the side's recent struggles on the pitch - they are 14th in the Premier League table - and repeated a pledge to deliver silverware by 2028.\nAnd talking just a day after fans protested against United's ownership, he also spoke of the club's financial difficulties, saying it was set to run out of money by the end of the year without taking actions he admitted were \"unpopular\".\nRatcliffe also spoke about:\nMarcus Rashford's departure from the club on loan to Aston Villa\nHow backing then sacking ex-manager Erik ten Hag - and hiring sporting director Dan Ashworth, who left after five months - were \"errors\"\nHow he believes the club had \"come off the rails\"\nHow he believes head coach Ruben Amorim will be at the club for \"a long time\"\nHow he plans to make Manchester United \"the most profitable club in the world\"\nPlans to deliver a new world-class stadium\nHis challenging first year at the club\nHis sympathy with fans for some of the changes he felt needed to be made\nAnd how he felt criticism over a perceived lack of support for the women's team was \"unfair\"\nSir Jim Ratcliffe: The Interview\n'Honest and truthful' or 'a load of tosh'? Fans on Ratcliffe interview\nFull transcript of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's interview\nThis video can not be played\nMonday Night Club: Reaction to Sir Jim Ratcliffe interview\nRatcliffe lamented the fact the club still had payments owed on players signed before he took control, citing what he said was a Â£17m payment still to be made for Sancho this summer.\nThe England winger was a Â£73m signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 but returned to the German club on loan after falling out with then-United boss Ten Hag and was loaned to Chelsea at the start of the current season.\n\"If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we're buying Antony, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying Onana, we're buying Hojlund, we're buying Sancho. These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things and have to sort that out.\n\"For Sancho, who now plays for Chelsea and we pay half his wages, we're paying Â£17m to buy him in the summer.\"\nBrazil winger Antony is another on loan, at Spanish club Real Betis, after struggling at Old Trafford following an Â£81.5m  move from Ajax.\nCompatriot Casemiro arrived in 2022 in a Â£70m deal, while Denmark striker Hojlund arrived the following year for Â£72m.\nCameroon international Onana joined the club in the same summer for Â£47.2m.\nAll those players have drawn criticism during their time at the club.\n\"It takes time for us to move away from the past into a new place in the future,\" Ratcliffe said.\nWhen asked whether he was suggesting those players were not good enough for Manchester United, he said: \"Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid, but for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time.\n\"We've got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future.\n\"There are some great players in the squad as we know, the captain is a fabulous footballer. We definitely need Bruno, he's a fantastic footballer.\"\nWhat is behind Hojlund's goal drought?\nThis video can not be played\n'Club is in period of change' - Ratcliffe on United's finances & inherited players\nPortuguese head coach Ruben Amorim was appointed in November following the sacking of Ten Hag.\nThe change has done little for the side's fortunes in league table terms - United have lost nine of their 26 games under him and are 36 points behind league leaders and rivals Liverpool.\nHowever a win at home to Real Sociedad this week will see them in the quarter-finals of the Europa League - and a step nearer to possible Champions League qualification, the prize for winning the competition.\nAnd Ratcliffe has given the 40-year-old his unwavering backing.\nHe said \"a long list of injuries\" had hampered a coach who arrived mid-season into a tough league and with English as his second language.\n\"If I actually look at the squad which is available to Ruben, I think he is doing a really good job to be honest,\" Ratcliffe said.\n\"I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do. He's an excellent manager and I think he will be there for a long time.\n\"You are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce. I think you saw a glimpse of it against Arsenal. How many players against Arsenal on the bench did you recognise? How many have ever worn a Manchester United shirt for [the first team]â¦ as there's no squad left. We are down to the last 10 or 11 men in the squad really, of proper first-team players. Ruben is doing a super job.\"\nHe also praised Amorim for attempting to put his stamp on the squad - England forward Rashford was sent on loan to Aston Villa after it became clear he was not part of the new manager's plans.\n\"He is, as most great coaches are, an emotional character. Ruben is not perfect but I am a great supporter of Ruben,\" he said.\n\"He wants a dressing room that is full of people who are totally committed to winning football matches. He won't tolerate people who don't have 100% of that attitude. The players have to be in the same box.\"\nRatcliffe added he was \"pleased\" to see Rashford performing well at Villa.\n\"He's moved out of Manchester and maybe that's a good thing for him,\" Ratcliffe said. \"I am very pleased he is doing well. It's good to see because he has got tremendous talent, but for whatever reason it wasn't working in Manchester for the past couple of seasons. But he is a very talented footballer, Rashford.\"\nRatcliffe also said players such as Rashford leaving permanently in the summer could help Amorim, who will have money to spend in the summer - despite the financial issues at the club.\n\"Obviously that budget changes based upon who we may choose to sell because that would supplement the budget,\" he said.\nAnd he stressed young talents such as midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and winger Alejandro Garnacho would not be up for sale just to bring in finances.\n\"No no. We won't be selling players because of the state we are in financially,\" he said.\n\"The club had got bloated so we reduced that and will finish it with a lean and efficient organisation. That's how we will address the costs. The player decisions will all be focused on how we are going to improve performance. That's all.\"\nMan Utd's Ratcliffe wants 'national stadium in north'\nThousands of Manchester United fans protested against the club's ownership before Sunday's Premier League fixture against Arsenal\nWhen Ratcliffe and Ineos joined the Old Trafford hierarchy, many fans welcomed the arrival of a boyhood fan and billionaire to help restore the club's former glories.\nHowever, a year on, the relationship with some supporters has soured.\nA mid-season rise in some ticket prices affecting under-16s and pensioners, and hundreds of redundancies are among the moves taken by the club which have attracted criticism, with cost-cutting measures including the removal of free lunches for staff.\nRatcliffe admitted he knew moving into the club would have challenges, \"but the scale of it is probably slightly bigger\" than he expected.\n\"I don't enjoy reading the newspaper very much these days I have to say,\" he added. \"I know it's unpopular, and this period of change is uncomfortable for people, and some of the decisions we have to make are unpleasant. But they are necessary to put Manchester United back on to a stable footing. If people want to see Manchester United winning trophies again then we have do all this stuff.\n\"I recognise I'm unpopular at the moment - but I am prepared to be, and I can deal with being unpopular for a period of time because I believe that what we're doing is the right thing.\n\"Manchester United has come off the rails - we need to get it back on the rails, and I believe what we are doing will put it back on the rails and we'll finish up being where Liverpool or Real Madrid are today in the future.\n\"When the going gets tough people need to show a bit of resilience, a bit of grit - don't wilt - and come out the other side fighting and that's what we will do.\"\nAnd he revealed just how stark the financial situation at the club had been: \"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put $300m (Â£232.72m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer.\n\"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans.\n\"The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\"\nHe said costs had risen and the club had been spending more than it earned for seven seasons.\n\"If you spend more than you earn eventually that's the road to ruin,\" he said.\nIt was suggested to Ratcliffe that the club's level of debt and serving that debt - in the last financial year Â£37m was paid in interest - was a more pressing issue for fans.\n\"Interest is one of the costs but it isn't the biggest cost in this club,\" he said.\n\"And the club needs to get its house back into order so it's on a good financial footing for the future.\n\"Most clubs in the UK - most companies - have debt of some form. But if the club is really profitable, which I think it will be in years to come, then you can do the reverse. You can start paying down the debt. That's where I think Manchester United should be.\n\"Ultimately, if you look at running the club the size of Manchester United with an income of about Â£650m you spend a part of that Â£650m on operating the club and part of it on the squad.\n\"Where do you want to spend the money? Do you want to spend it on operating the club, or do you want to spend it on the squad? Because if you spend it on the squad you get better results. And at the end of the day what's Manchester United here for if it's not to win trophies and silverware? What we want to do is invest in the best players in the world if we can, rather than spend it on, I'm afraid, free lunches.\n\"My only interest here is returning Manchester United back to greatness again.\"\nHe also said financial pressures on Ineos which led to the ending of a sponsorship deal with New Zealand All Blacks would not impact on Manchester United.\nThis video can not be played\nSir Jim Ratcliffe talks Man Utd finances, stadium plans & Ruben Amorim\nRatcliffe does, though, admit not every decision taken has been the right one.\n\"We are not perfect, and we are on a journey, and there have been a couple of errors along the way, but I think in the main all the things we are doing are the right things for the club,\" he said.\nOne of those errors was the hiring of sporting director Dan Ashworth - who then left the role after just five months.\nRatcliffe said the \"chemistry\" was not right, leading to his departure.\nBacking Ten Hag in the summer, only for the Dutch coach to leave a few months later, he admitted was another mistake - it cost the club around Â£20m to compensate Ten Hag and his team and then bring in Amorim.\n\"I agree the Erik ten Tag and Dan Ashworth decisions were errors. I think there were some mitigating circumstances, but ultimately they were errors. I accept that and I apologise for that.\n\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik the management team hadn't been in place more than five minutes,\" he explained, adding that it was difficult to judge the Dutchman's performance under the previous regime.\n\"It became clearer three months later and we got it wrong, but we'd moved on. I think we corrected it and we are in a very different place today,\" he added.\nRatcliffe believes those changes, coupled with the operational changes, will help the club to move forward and repeated his target of winning the Premier League by 2028 - the club's 150th anniversary.\n\"I don't think it's mission impossible. I think it's good to have goals and objectives, Ratcliffe said.\n\"If you look at Arsenal, if you look at Liverpool, if you look at the period of time it took them to get the house in order and get back to winning ways, that's probably slightly on the short end of the spectrum. But it's not impossible.\"\nThe club is also preparing to announce plans that could see \"the most iconic football stadium in the world\" being built to replace the existing stadium, as part of a wider regeneration scheme.\nAn announcement is expected on Tuesday.\n\"The club's going to finish up in a very very different place in three years' time to where its been in the past, in my view,\" Ratcliffe added.\n\"I think it will become the most profitable club in the world. I think we may well finish up with the most iconic football stadium in the world, and I think we will finish up winning silverware again.\"\nDuring his tenure, another area for criticism Ratcliffe has faced has been for how much support the women's team is receiving from the Old Trafford hierarchy.\nSpeaking to the United We Stand fanzine last year, he described the men's team as the \"main issue\" and referred to the women's side as \"girls\" and \"an opportunity\".\nSuch quotes were compounded by not being present as the women lifted the FA Cup, while it has been claimed he asked women's captain Katie Zelem what her role was at the club during a tour of training facilities.\nSo what does he make of the criticism?\n\"It's a bit unfair,\" Ratcliffe said.\n\"What I said at the beginning was my main focus is on the men's team because that, at the end of the day, is what moves the needle at Manchester United. The women's team is much smaller than the men's team.\n\"Of our Â£650m of income, Â£640m of that comes from the men's team and Â£10m comes from the women's team. With my business background you tend to focus on the bigger issues before you focus on the smaller issues.\n\"But the women's team wear the Manchester United brand, the Manchester United logo, so in that sense they are every bit as important as the men's team. And frankly, they are doing better than the men's team - they are second in the league and won the FA Cup last season. Marc Skinner is doing a great job as the coach and the new captain Maya [le Tissier] is doing a great job.\nWhen asked if he wanted to clear up the Zelem reports, he answered: \"No, not really. I did ask Maya if she was related to Matt [le Tissier] but the answer was no.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications"

Maybe we ran out of luck because the margins were so small.\n\"We played the perfect game, except for scoring a goal.

        "title": "'Dessers leads way for weirdest Rangers team ever'",
        "content": "Cyriel Dessers scored one goal, assisted another, and had two efforts disallowed against Fenerbahce\nJust short of the hour mark in Istanbul, after he had scored Rangers' first, brilliantly assisted their second, then came inches away, twice, from adding a third, Cyriel Dessers reminded you of a boxer, dancing around the ring, toying with a bewildered opponent.\nThe Fenerbahce backline were on the ropes. Their defences were down and so were their heads. They remonstrated with each other about this menace in their midst and their inability to stop him. Dessers was running amok.\nThere were many major performers on this night of nights for Rangers - all of them, quite frankly - but Dessers was one of the star turns.\nRangers folk have had a torrid relationship with him. A kind of Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor vibe if you are old enough to catch the drift, an on-off thing, love and hate, tempestuous, never dull.\nThe big man scored his fourth European goal of the season and delivered his fourth assist. He is on 22 goals this term now, to match the 22 he got last season.\n'Calm down, it's not over', Mourinho warns Rangers\nRangers earn stunning win over Fenerbahce\nRangers reaction, analysis & have your say\nIf you look back over Rangers' past 25 to 30 years, you'll see that Alfredo Morelos and Kris Boyd managed back-to-back 20-plus goal seasons in the top flight, but it is a pantheon with few heroes.\nThat's not a word many among the Rangers support would associate with Dessers.\nHe has spoken before about feeling written off only months into his first season at the club - last season - how his misses were more talked about than his goals and how it made him feel like the worst Rangers player ever. His description.\nOn Thursday, he looked like one of the best Rangers strikers of several decades. Classy, dangerous, resilient, he was inches away from an away European hat-trick.\nOne goal, one assist and one lovely cushioned pass to Nico Raskin before his sumptuous delivery to Vaclav Cerny for the goal that made it 3-1 was a mighty contribution from a maligned player who just keeps going no matter the doubt that rings in his ears from the stands.\nMaybe that has changed now. Or, perhaps, it is changing. Not there yet, but moving fast in the right direction.\nMaybe you could say the same about Rangers in Europe.\nThis tie isn't over, but they produced something very special in Istanbul and take a two-goal buffer to Glasgow next week. Nobody saw that coming. Absolutely nobody.\nThey were immense. Had they won by four instead of two then Jose Mourinho suggested that he could have had no complaints.\nThis was a glorious night for the 'Four Bears' - the interim coaching team of former Rangers men led by Barry Ferguson - and a continuation of the surreality that surrounds this collection of players.\nDefeats in recent weeks by Motherwell, St Mirren and Queen's Park in the Scottish Cup. A manager sacked. A support in uproar. A Glasgow rival laughing in their face, 16 points clear in the league and so far ahead on every metric that you wonder when, or if, the chasm between them will close.\nA team that struggles hopelessly when dealing with the low blocks of smaller clubs domestically - they have dropped points in 11 out of 29 league matches - and then delivers their very best stuff against better teams in European football.\nSigmund Freud could not get to the heart of this lot. He would end up on the couch himself with Carl Jung waving a fan and some smelling salts in his face.\nFrom joyless defeats at home against teams with fractions of their budget to steepling victories away against European big shots, this lays claim to be the oddest of all Rangers sides, the one that is capable of the most jaw-dropping extremes.\nThis video can not be played\n'Brilliant result but I'm not getting carried away' - Ferguson\nIs there one to rival them in the Rangers 'odditorium'? Club historians will have plenty to say on that.\nIn more recent memory, the Giovanni van Bronckhorst side of 2021-22 are worth a mention. They got to the Europa League final that season, only losing on penalties.\nThey beat the Borussia Dortmund of Mats Hummels, Raphael Guerreiro and Jude Bellingham then the RB Leipzig of Konrad Laimer, Josko Gvardiol, Dani Olmo and Dominik Szoboszlai.\nOne missed penalty in the final shootout against an Eintracht Frankfurt side later broken up and sold on for serious money was all that stopped them.\nAll of those massive nights against heavy-hitters in Europe and they had to settle for second place in the Scottish Premiership to Ange Postecoglou's new Celtic team.\nThere are big differences between that team and the Rangers of today, though. Van Bronckhorst's lot fought hard domestically, losing the league by just four points and winning the Scottish Cup.\nThey were never as far off the pace in Scotland as the current crew, and never displayed the kind of incredible turbulence that has been so pervasive this season.\nWinston Churchill described the geo-politics of the old Soviet Union as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma - a description that could be stolen and applied to the twin personalities of this Rangers outfit.\nFenerbahce, like others before them, afforded Rangers time and space on the not unreasonable premise that a team not good enough to score against second-tier opposition in Scotland was hardly likely to cause them too many problems.\nBig mistake. Huge. They reckoned without the Jekyll and Hyde, the domestic Rangers and the European Rangers, the Rangers who have the devil's own job in breaking down defensive teams in the Premiership but who are like kids in candy stores in Europe when there is space and an ability to counter-attack.\nDessers typified the effort: strutting, lethal and head and shoulders ahead of more celebrated strikers down the other end.\nFerguson and his coaches deserve huge credit for a formation shift to three at the back, which worked well. For sending their team out with belief when those players had reason not to believe.\nAnd for delivering a massive result that sets up a pulse-quickening night at Ibrox next Thursday. Bonkers, but brilliantly so."

        "title": "Palmer 'wanted to be on pitch' after fever as barren run continued",
        "content": "Cole Palmer has gone nine matches without scoring and his last assist was on 1 December\nChelsea's Cole Palmer might have found a new way to fire a blank as he missed a Premier League penalty for the first time in the 1-0 win at home to Leicester City - but the fact he played at all was perhaps equally noteworthy on Sunday.\nGoing into the match, Palmer's involvement was in doubt after he missed training with a fever but insisted on playing to \"help the team\".\nAnd the England international was perfectly placed to end his goal drought - standing at eight games going into the match - in the 22nd minute but his well-struck effort was saved by goalkeeper Mads Hermansen.\nPreviously, Palmer had scored all 12 of his penalty kicks in the Premier League, beating the record for perfect attempts held previously by former Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure.\nIt was the latest episode in a dip in form since the end of 2024. Last year, he scored 26 times and delivered 13 assists in the Premier League, more than any other player in England's top-flight during that period. He also broke the Chelsea club record for goal involvements in a calendar year.\nBut having also squandered several big chances in the 4-0 win against Southampton last week, the signs are that his confidence is on the wane.\nPalmer has varied his finishes from the penalty spot, but stats show that shooting with his left foot across to his right is his favoured option.\nThis is likely something that Hermansen will have known and he managed to get across the goal to save the shot despite it being close to the corner.\nFormer Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Cole Palmer's penalty wasn't one from someone with a lot of confidence. He went for power over real placement and the goalkeeper does so, so well. It wasn't his best penalty.\n\"It's just not happening for Cole Palmer at the moment. The longer it goes on, there is more frustration and there will be more the element of trying to be selfish and making the wrong decisions.\"\nThere was a two minute and 24 second wait to take the penalty that can't have helped - as Chelsea and Leicester players argued on the edge of the box - and referee Tim Robinson asked him to re-spot the ball.\nUltimately the penalty miss did not matter for Chelsea as Marc Cucurella popped up with the long-range winner in the 60th minute as they hung on to the win despite a nervy end.\nIt was also arguably Palmer's worst performance of the season as he was substituted in the 73rd minute, the fourth-earliest he has come off in a match since joining the club.\nHowever, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said there was a reason the forward was perhaps not at his very best.\n\"It's very easy: Cole didn't train yesterday and during the night he didn't feel well,\" Maresca said.\n\"The reason why he didn't train yesterday is fever and diarrhoea in the last 48 hours. This morning, he woke up and he asked me, 'I want to be on the pitch because I want to help this team, this club to play Champions League'.\n\"This shows how these players want to bring the club where it belongs to.\"\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nFour spots, 10 teams - how Champions League race is gearing up\nCucurella fires Chelsea into top four with Leicester win\nThis video can not be played\nChelsea's Maresca reacts to 'great win' against Leicester\nPalmer is on a nine-game goalless run in all competitions, extending back to his last goal on 14 January against Bournemouth.\nThe last time he registered an assist stretched back even longer to 1 December, these being his longest barren runs since joining Chelsea.\nBut there are numbers behind these two headline statistics that reveal more about this run in the league.\nIn chasing that elusive goal, Palmer is shooting more with 4.2 shots per game in matches since he last scored compared to 3.6 beforehand, though his shots inside the box remain the same at 1.9 per match.\nHe is also averaging 5.2 touches in the opposition box since his last goal which is up from 4.0 but, despite being up on certain metrics, his expected goals, excluding penalties, has dropped to 0.39 from 0.46, which suggests the quality of chances that he is being presented with are worse.\nPalmer remains Chelsea's top goalscorer in the Premier League on 14 goals this season.\nHowever, despite certain metrics increasing on shots taken, Palmer's creative stats are down in the league.\nHe is down from 2.8 chances per 90 minutes created since his last assist on 1 December to 2.5 - and chances created from open play (excluding set-pieces) is down from 2.5 to 1.8.\nThe quality of the chances he has created, however, is up to 0.30 per game from 0.22. The expected assists, the ranking which ranks how likely a player is to score from a chance that is created, is 4.73 which suggests that his team-mates should have scored at least four goals from his passes and crosses since the start of December.\nIt still does not feel like Chelsea are fully back to form despite back-to-back wins for the first time since between November and December.\nOn Sunday, Chelsea supporters again booed players who passed the ball backwards and, after Cucurella's goal, Maresca turned to supporters and told them to pump up the volume.\nWhen addressing the situation in his post-match comments, the Italian added: \"People have to understand this is our way, our style, and this is the way we are going to play. When a team creates the number of chances we created today you have to be happy.\n\"It's not easy. Leicester until minute 83 were 0-0 against Arsenal. The same thing happened against [Manchester] City. If you think football is just PlayStation and you win easy? No way. Every game is difficult.\"\nThe Blues had looked like title contenders while in second place December and the fans were chanting \"we've got our Chelsea back\" during a win at home to Brentford.\nHowever, they then went on a run of just two wins in 10 matches and  the chants of \"we want our Chelsea back\" returned from last season.\nBut victory, even if unconvincing, sees Chelsea leapfrog Manchester City and move back in fourth place with Champions League qualification back in the club's sights for the first time under this new ownership.\nArsenal and Tottenham are up next for Chelsea, with fixtures against  Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester United also to come in their final 10 league matches.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone"

Sometimes it is just best to take in the chaos and unpredictability of it all and hope your team comes out on the right side it.\nThe margins between immediate passage to the Premier League and the potential pain of the play-offs means no-one involved can be so relaxed - and there is a palpable sense of pressure around each and every game now.\nOver the past 48 hours, both Leeds boss Farke and his Sheffield United counterpart Chris Wilder have used the phrase \"to the wire\" in terms of how this promotion race is going to go, and you would imagine Burnley manager Scott Parker will be following them pretty soon.\nBBC Sport has examined some of the statistical markers of relevance to the top four in the Championship as we enter the final 10 games of the 2024-25 campaign to decide who will be playing top-flight football next season.\nLeeds United\nBased on the respective league positions of their opponents, Leeds have a far more agreeable run-in among than their automatic promotion rivals. On current standings, the highest-placed team they have to face are Bristol City, in seventh, at Elland Road in the penultimate game of the season.\nAs a side point, the Robins have not won at that particular ground since 1979, so while they may be the 'best' team Leeds are still to play, the hosts have the considerable weight of history as well as the carrot of Premier League football.\nMillwall (H)\nQPR (A)\nSwansea (H)\nLuton (A)\nMiddlesbrough (A)\nPreston (H)\nOxford (A)\nStoke (H)\nBristol City (H)\nPlymouth (A)\nSheffield United\nThe play-off seeking Robins are the visitors to Bramall Lane on Tuesday, followed by the Steel City Derby this weekend - which is shaping up to be a pretty defining few days for the Blades.\nNot to mention the arrival of Coventry City after the international break, with Frank Lampard's side having won nine of their past 10 to thrust themselves into play-off contention.\nThat trip to Turf Moor on Easter Monday also looks pretty seismic given the small margins that exist between these teams and the potential for that win to separate Sheffield United from the Clarets, and potentially vice versa, of course.\nBristol City (H)\nSheffield Wednesday (A)\nCoventry (H)\nOxford (A)\nMillwall (H)\nPlymouth (A)\nCardiff (H)\nBurnley (A)\nStoke (A)\nBlackburn (H)\nBurnley beat Sheffield United 2-0 on Boxing Day\nBurnley\nOf the automatic promotion contenders, the Clarets have by far the toughest schedule, with three top-six teams to play â starting with West Brom â and matches against four others who would consider themselves to be in the play-off hunt.\nWest Brom (H)\nSwansea (A)\nBristol City (H)\nCoventry (A)\nDerby (A)\nNorwich (H)\nWatford (A)\nSheffield United (H)\nQPR (A)\nMillwall (H)\nSunderland\nThe Black Cats have it all to do. But with the lack of expectancy and pressure, it could lead to them creeping up the table and applying further stress on those above them.\nFortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your viewpoint, they don't face any of the three teams above them â which could enable them to take points off their rivals â but they do take on Coventry and West Brom before the end of the season, who occupy the places immediately below them.\nPreston (H)\nCoventry (A)\nMillwall (H)\nWest Brom (A)\nNorwich (A)\nSwansea (H)\nBristol City (A)\nBlackburn (H)\nOxford (A)\nQPR (H)\nAnger giving way to anxiety and angst may have abided among Leeds fans following their defeat at Portsmouth, but according to Opta's prediction model they are still forecast to come out top of the Championship pile at around 14:30 GMT on May 3.\nAlso of note is that while there are sure to be some fluctuations in positioning, based on current calculations the top six right now will be the same order when the regular season draws to a close in just under eight weeks' time.\nBased on the past 10 Championship seasons, the average points of those securing a place in the top two has been 92.4, or 93 should you wish to round-up for simplicity and peace of mind.\nLeeds and Sheffield United are 17 points shy of that mark, and require 1.7 points per game over the remainder of the campaign to get there, while Burnley are 19 adrift and need 1.9, and Sunderland 25 and 2.5 â further emphasising the turn of events that needs to transpire for the Black Cats to get over the line.\nFor reference, Leeds have averaged 2.11 points per game this season, and Sheffield United 2.16 (taking into account their two-point deduction) - the Whites 2.3 over their past 10 and the Blades 2.4. Burnley are on 2.05 for the campaign overall and 2.2 taking in their previous 10.\nWest Brom secured their place in the top flight in 2019-20 with just 83 points, as the lowest number within this sample size, whereas at the other end of the scale, Ipswich Town stormed over the line with 96 among second-placed teams.\nOf course, that isn't necessarily what's required to make it, because ultimately all a runner-up needs to do is finish above the side in third by means of one point or even just goal difference - pertinent given how tight things currently are.\nThe average points recorded by third-placed teams over the past 10 seasons has been 85.1, which  leaves 86 as a potential number to rubber-stamp promotion, but so close are the contenders in 2024-25, that seems a dangerously low target.\nThe highest points haul for a third-placed team in the Championship in the 21st century was Leeds last season with 90. There's every chance that will be exceeded this term.\nChampionship top-two fight will go to wire - Wilder"

        "content": "This video can not be played\nHighlights: How Spain got the better of England in the Euro 2024 final\nSo close, and yet so far for England - again.\nGareth Southgate's side reached the final for a second successive European Championship, only to fall short of ending the men's team's wait of more than half a century for a major trophy.\nTheir journey to Berlin, where they were beaten 2-1 by Spain on Sunday, was far from smooth. At times there was criticism of England's style of play and the failure to best utilise a squad packed with young, attacking talent.\nThe final followed a similar pattern to their other knockout games - concede the first goal and then mount a comeback - but it was Spain who found a late winner on this occasion.\nWere England \"brave enough\"? Did they \"roll the dice\" when required in Germany? Should this disappointment be the cue for a tactical reset?\nIn the final, England had 35% possession, nine attempts at goal compared to Spain's 16, and 16 touches in the opposition's penalty area compared to 30 for Spain.\nEx-England striker Gary Lineker said on BBC One that it was a \"heartbreaking defeat for England, but in some ways a victory for attacking football\".\nRio Ferdinand and Chris Sutton were among those of the opinion that England had not been sufficiently \"brave\" during their time in Germany.\n\"Whenever these players in this England team have won things with their clubs, they've got the quality, but they're all brave in the big moments,\" said former England centre-back Ferdinand on BBC One.\n\"They're courageous, they take risks, they take chances. They don't wait to go behind, they take chances when the game's in the balance and when it's most difficult.\n\"When you win stuff, you have to have that courage and just lay it out there, roll the dice at times and you can't always play from a conservative position.\"\nFormer Premier League winner Sutton, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, added: \"England were not brave enough on the evening to make the next step.\n\"It is a good thing for football that Spain won the tournament with the brand they have played. Spain played the beautiful game and England didn't - the beauty of Gareth's team has been getting over the line.\n\"Spain are a team. England are bits and pieces.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFerdinand, Mata & Richards discuss all three goals from the Euro 2024 final\nFormer England defender Micah Richards believes this is the time for a tactical rethink.\nHe said on BBC One: \"I've said from the start that I think England have the best squad but I don't think we're the best team, in terms of all the combinations we expect to see.\"\nAsked why he had that opinion, Richards said: \"Because we have a manager who has been successful being defensive, getting into a semi-final of a World Cup and two Euros [finals], and we've not been able to push this team forward in the way it deserves.\n\"That's no slight on Gareth Southgate, that's just his tactics.\n\"Now we have to move forward in the right direction and play the football these players play at club level.\"\nOn ITV, ex-defender Gary Neville said England \"didn't keep the ball well enough and every England manager has said that - it's the same pattern\", while his former Manchester United team-mate Roy Keane said England \"lacked quality\" and their \"fight and desire off the bench\" helped to get them to the final.\nDefeat extends England's '58 years of hurt'\nSouthgate says 'now not the time' to decide future\n'Lowest of the lows' - England stars 'devastated' after loss\nWith Southgate's side having failed to lift the trophy, Ferdinand said questions about England's more \"conservative\" approach would have to follow.\n\"We said after the group stage that if you're going to play on the conservative side of things, with the amount of talent we have in this squad, you have to win,\" Ferdinand said, \"otherwise it will be dissected and be looked at as quite a negative approach.\n\"That falls on the manager's toes because he sets his team out in a particular way to play and that's his style of football.\n\"But you have to win playing like that, because these players play too well for their teams in club football to then come here and look a shadow of themselves a lot of the time.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'It hurts' - Shearer on England's Euro 2024 final defeat\nSouthgate said after the match that it was too soon for him to be considering his future as England manager.\nSince taking charge a few months after a humiliating Euro 2016 exit at the hands of Iceland and following Sam Allardyce's one-match reign as manager, Southgate has led his country to two European Championship finals, as well as a World Cup semi-final in 2018 and a quarter-final in 2022.\n\"When Gareth started off, England were in big trouble,\" said ex-England captain Alan Shearer on BBC One.\n\"He has dragged us from the very bottom and taken us to nearly a team that can be successful. But we've had that three years ago, we've got a better team and squad now, so when that happens, expectations are higher and you've got to cope with that.\n\"Getting to finals when you have got the quality of players like England have, and not winning it, is not going to be good enough.\n\"They have got a togetherness, they have got a steel about them, but I think they are better than what they have shown us.\"\nRichards added: \"In the early part of his tenure, he probably overachieved. Now the expectancy level has gone up with these players, it was always going to be difficult.\n\"He got us to a final and we've had a great day, but I just think we needed a little bit more urgency and spark.\""

        "content": "Teenager Lennon Miller's stoppage-time penalty against Dundee United sent Motherwell through to Sunday's League Cup semi-final with Rangers\nScottish League Cup semi-final: Motherwell v Rangers\nVenue: Hampden, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 3 November Kick-off: 15:00 GMT\nCoverage: Listen to match commentary on BBC Sounds and follow live text updates on BBC Sport website & app\nA \"wee Champions League ball\" is bouncing perfectly for Lennon Miller in the Aberdeen players' lounge.\nFather Lee, then a striker at the Pittodrie club, is blown away again by the freakish technique of his two-year-old son when he \"absolutely creams one\" on the volley.\nWith the ball mid-flight, his astonishment instantly turns to horror when the wife of then Aberdeen manager Jimmy Calderwood swings open the door to the lounge with a glass of wine in her hand.\nSmash. Splash. \"She was soaking,\" Lee recalls. \"We all just stopped and were thinking, 'how's she going to react to this?'. But she just laughed it off.\"\nAt the same age, the former Scotland striker also remembers his young son oddly having the knowledge to dry the ball with his top before taking a throw.\nAnd by the time he was four, the Motherwell midfielder was attempting corners on 11-a-side pitches, even though he \"couldn't hit the 18-yard box\".\nNeedless to say, football was - and still is - young Miller's life, but his world was turned upside down at the age of just five following the loss of mother Donna, who died in 2012 after having cancer.\nNow 18, and already a talismanic figure at Fir Park, doing mum proud is what drives the teenager - and with each passing week that drive looks destined to take him to the top of the game.\n\"Going through that at such a young age, football has been my escape from such a devastating thing,\" Miller tells BBC Scotland.\n\"I felt like every time I was in the house it was catching up on me and every time I was out on the pitch I forgot about it.\n\"If I was upset I'd always think about football, I'd talk to my dad about football. It was just my way of escaping it.\"\nPodcast: Motherwell's Miller on grief, inspiration & ambitions\nMaswanhise brace gives Motherwell win at Dundee Utd\nVisit our Motherwell page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nMiller only turned 18 in August, yet he has already made 53 first-team appearances in claret and amber.\nThe biggest occasion of his early career is set to come on Sunday, though, when Motherwell face Rangers in the Scottish League Cup last four at Hampden.\nIt was the teenager's 91st-minute penalty against Dundee United in the previous round that booked the Fir Park side their first semi-final in more than six years.\nThe moment referee John Beaton pointed to the spot, dad Lee could barely watch in the stand - not because he doubted his son, but instead due to his history of dinking penalties.\n\"I've always had one in my locker and I've always enjoyed seeing the goalie raging,\" Miller jokes.\n\"I've probably said to my dad before that if I get one, I'll dink it. But I've seen the goalie go early so I thought I'd leave it.\"\nThe fact someone so young would take the penalty in such a high-pressure situation says it all about the laidback manner in which Miller plays the game.\nAnd it was that composed style that made him \"stand out like a sore thumb\" when Stuart Ogilvie, Motherwell's long-serving head of academy recruitment, watched Miller for the first time with Cambusnethan Talbot boys club.\n\"He was spraying passes all over the place, running the game just the way he does now,\" says Ogilvie, who also scouted former Scotland forward James McFadden and ex-Celtic midfielder David Turnbull for Motherwell.\n\"I've been in the scouting game for 30 years - 25 of which have been at Motherwell - and the feeling I got when I watched Lennon was the same as when I watched James and David.\"\nMiller dedicated his first professional contract at Motherwell to his late mum in 2022\nOgilvie thought his chance had gone when he learned Miller had been training with Celtic, but he dropped out of their academy after feeling the demands were \"too much pressure at such a young age\".\nWithin weeks he was part of Motherwell's youth set-up and quickly became \"the talk of the steamie\" within the coaching staff.\nThroughout his rapid development, the decision was made for Miller to train and play with older age groups - something the midfielder feels only enhanced his ability to \"take the ball under pressure\".\nAnd away from the Motherwell academy, father Lee would even allow his son to train with Falkirk while he was their manager.\nInterest from south of the border in the youngster was high, but three years later - six days after his 16th birthday - Miller became Motherwell's youngest ever player when he came on in a League Cup win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle.\nWhile he watched some team-mates leave for academies of bigger clubs, Miller understood the importance of the pathway there for him - one the likes of Turnbull, Allan Campbell, Chris Cadden, James Scott and Jake Hastie have benefitted from in recent years.\n\"That's all I wanted to do, play first-team football, because my dad told me that's the best way of developing,\" Miller says.\n\"Moving on and maybe not getting that, I thought that wasn't a good idea. I didn't want to be playing academy football for the rest of my career.\"\nThat patience and understanding, when it might have been easier to jump at a more lucrative academy contract elsewhere, has paid off big time.\nDespite a two-month injury lay-off, Miller enjoyed a stellar breakthrough campaign last term, playing 32 games in a deep-lying midfield position.\nHis fearless ability to take the ball from the defence and link play caught the eye, but this season has shown there are more strings to his bow.\nDeployed in a more advanced midfield role, he has already scored three and assisted four in 16 games, while only three players in the Premiership have created more chances.\n\"It's completely different to what I was playing last year,\" Miller said of his new role. \"It's taken time to get used to and I'm reaping the rewards now.\"\nDespite the pressures of first-team football, Miller's risk-taking remains, from his exquisite turn to set up his team's opener against Celtic in February to his clever free-kick assist for the first goal at Hibernian earlier this month.\nThere are far more occasions when those risks do not pay off, but \"there's no point worrying what people think,\" he says. \"Just reset, get the ball back, and do it again\".\nBut where does that mindset come from? Miller has always been inspired by Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne, but he feels the loss of his mum, who always wanted him to be a footballer, has been a \"massive factor\".\nAfter all, misplacing a pass is meaningless in comparison to what he had to endure in his early life. So \"why not try the risky pass,\" he adds.\nThat gallus approach is attracting attention. Even in a 3-0 defeat by Celtic last Sunday, Miller's all-round game stood out, striking the woodwork twice.\nA clip then circulated of veteran broadcaster Martin Tyler waxing lyrical about the teenager, while former Scotland striker Kris Boyd suggested the midfielder is now out of reach for both Old Firm clubs.\nExperienced Motherwell duo Andy Halliday and Paul McGinn have also said Miller, who ended Wednesday's win at Tannadice with the captain's armband, is the best youngster they have ever played with.\nWhen you consider Halliday trained with a teenage Billy Gilmour at Rangers, plus McGinn's younger brother is Aston Villa captain John, the comments are \"obviously a huge honour\" for Miller.\nBut with the help of dad Lee - now a barber and a good one at that, according to his son - the youngster is able to keep a lid on things by putting plaudits and speculation to one side.\nA Scotland Under-21 international, much of the chat surrounding the teenager has been whether he is capable of making the step up to the senior squad.\nHis dad believes he is \"good enough\" now, while Miller says \"I'll be ready\" whenever the call comes.\nRegardless, it feels somewhat poignant that his first appearance at the national stadium is set to come for the club he has dedicated more than half his life to.\nThe Fir Park club travel to Hampden knowing victory against a troubled Rangers side would take them to within a win of their first major honour in 33 years.\nMiller recognises Motherwell will still be \"massive underdogs\" in the tie, but the teenager is eyeing an opportunity to make himself, along with his team-mates, a club legend.\n\"We just need to go out there and enjoy it,\" he says. \"That's all we can do, we know it's a massive game for everybody involved.\n\"And we know we have a chance to make history - that's the main aim.\""

        "title": "'No regrets' - Eidevall on Arsenal exit, losing fans and move to NWSL",
        "content": "It has been five months since Jonas Eidevall unexpectedly decided to walk away from his position as Arsenal manager.\nNow the 42-year-old is looking forward to a new chapter in the United States as head coach of NWSL side San Diego Wave, with the season getting under way this weekend.\nEidevall tells BBC Sport about the reasons behind his Arsenal exit, why he has no regrets over letting record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema leave and the challenge facing him in the NWSL.\n'Shock' at Eidevall resignation but not his exit\nEidevall criticises 'amateurish behaviour' with fixture schedule\nDuring the Swede's three years at Arsenal he guided them to three consecutive top-three finishes but the closest they came to unseating Chelsea as Women's Super League champions came in his first campaign when they ended a point adrift of the Blues.\nHe claimed the club's first trophy in four years when they won the League Cup in 2023, and they retained it the following year, but further silverware eluded him.\nHis final game came against the side which had proved his biggest nemesis, Chelsea, as he oversaw a 2-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium in front of increasingly disillusioned supporters.\n\"I thought the easiest quick fix in this moment here now is for me to step away,\" he says.\n\"It was extremely tough, both for me personally - my family of course - but also professionally. It's a privilege to be leading a club like Arsenal.\n\"It's very special when you're there, so an extremely difficult decision to make.\"\nThe departure of striker Miedema, who scored 125 goals and provided 50 assists in 172 appearances, to Manchester City during the summer had piled the pressure on Eidevall before the season had even begun.\nHe has previously spoken to Sky Sports, external about how he \"lost quite a lot of my relationship with the supporters\" when he decided not to renew Miedema's contract, so does he have any regrets?\n\"I don't. I think you always take the best decisions as you can make for the club at that point with the information that you know,\" he says.\n\"You can't rethink decisions based on new information that you could not have known at that time. That's not a helpful way of thinking about life. So no regrets.\n\"I do think that that decision was a big part in my relationship with the supporters [deteriorating].\n\"I never took any decision to be liked. I always took decisions because I felt they were the best for the club and for the team,\" adds Eidevall, who signed Spain World Cup winner Mariona Caldentey as a replacement.\n\"But the problem is when you take those decisions and you don't get the results then of course it very much spirals.\"\nStrong results did not materialise.\nThe north London club were sixth in the WSL after winning just one of their opening four games, while they suffered a demoralising 5-2 defeat at Bayern Munich in the Champions League three days before that defeat at home to Chelsea, where some fans could be seen clamouring for his sacking by waving P45 signs.\nSo, on the Monday after that match, Eidevall informed the club of his intention to step down.\nAsked whether the club were surprised, he says: \"Yeah I think so.\"\nYet it ended up being a quick process, explains Eidevall, who had not told the club he wanted to leave the next day, but that's when his departure was announced.\n\"They were onboard with that decision [to leave], which very much told me that if the club is onboard with that decision it's 100% the right decision to walk away,\" he adds.\n\"So that gave me that little bit extra sense of clarity in where we were at.\"\nWith time to reflect on his departure, he looks back on his spell in north London fondly, focusing on the \"immense growth\" the team went through off the pitch.\n\"Both my mission - and also the club's - was to make sure that Arsenal was back to the top of the women's game,\" he says.\n\"I think you can argue on a lot of levels right now Arsenal are that, with having the Emirates as the main home, having really, really good attendances both home and away, having much-improved facilities and staffing around the team, and having a team that has a better mix of youth and more experienced players.\n\"That part is really good, and I can see my part that I played in that.\"\nOn the pitch, he says that \"you can argue quite fairly\" that Arsenal were the second-best team in the UK behind Chelsea during his time as manager, if you take all the competitions into account.\n\"When you see the resources - with player salaries and other costs around the team - Chelsea are by far the biggest spender and it reasonable that they are also the best team,\" Eidevall says.\n\"To be above [Manchester] City and below Chelsea is probably a reasonable result to get from what was invested.\n\"Would I have liked to get a league title? Yes, very much. Then I would have been very, very happy with the results.\"\nEidevall was announced as the new San Diego Wave head coach in January, becoming the permanent replacement for former England captain Casey Stoney, who was sacked in June.\nHe says after leaving Arsenal \"there was quite a bit of interest immediately from various club teams and national teams\" and he spoke to a few different clubs, including San Diego.\nThe \"long-term vision\" at the Californian club really appealed to him, as well as the \"competitiveness\" of the NWSL itself.\nHowever, Eidevall is joining a league undergoing big changes,, external with this year the first time there will be no annual draft - making it the first major US professional sports league to abolish the draft system and aligning the competition closer to other women's football leagues around the world.\nHis club are also going through a period of transition having lost two of their biggest names - Naomi Girma to Chelsea and Alex Morgan to retirement - and they navigated the second-half of the season without a permanent coach.\nHe describes Girma as an \"irreplaceable player\" but says the defender was \"set on leaving\" before his arrival.\nYet despite the huge turnover of players at the club, he says the team's goal should still be \"to reach the play-offs\" at the end of the season.\n\"It feels like a complete rebuild to be honest,\" he says. \"That's the challenge but also the opportunity.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page"

        "title": "'Switch flicked' but Rangers still left with regrets",
        "content": "Philippe Clement is yet to beat Celtic as Rangers manager\nWhen the Rangers players emerged from the tunnel at Hampden Park, they were greeted by a banner among their support that read 'Eyes on the prize'.\nFor 120 minutes - plus penalties - against Celtic, their focus on winning the League Cup trophy was certainly intense.\nOnly a matter of weeks ago, finding a sizable section of fans with confidence that Phillipe Clement's side would retain their silverware would have been a struggle.\nBut, as former Ibrox striker Billy Dodds said on BBC Sportsound \"a switch has been flicked\" in recent times.\n\"Three weeks ago, something changed. Rangers were ready for this,\" he added.\n\"Now they have to prove that the bar has been set and it's the long-term vision.\"\nCeltic beat Rangers on penalties to win epic six-goal League Cup final\nSix goals, 10 pens & 120 minutes of Old Firm chaos\nFootball fans throw missiles in pre-match violence\nA myriad reasons contributed to the lack of belief among Rangers' most ardent admirers as autumn turned to winter.\nThe lead, which now stands at 11 points, Celtic hold in the league was one. The inconsistency of Rangers was another. And the routine manner in which Brendan Rodgers' side brushed aside their rivals in September strengthened the sentiment.\nThis was nothing like that 3-0 defeat, though.\nEven when Rangers went 2-1 down having taken the lead at the national stadium, they didn't look out. Their heads didn't drop and they didn't retreat into their familiar cocoon to allow Celtic to dominate.\nEven Celtic defender Liam Scales credited Rangers for \"the battle\" they brought and  the \"carnage\" that ensued.\nAccording to Dodds, they showed \"the right mental strength\" to take into a game against the league champions, while another former Ibrox player, Neil McCann, said they \"were miles ahead of where they were\" in September.\nSeldom do the losing team in a cup final come out with so much praise, but Rangers' impressive, passionate and energetic performance led former Scotland defender Willie Miller to describe it as \"a good cup final\" for them.\n\"If being defeated in a cup final can be a good thing, that is,\" Miller added.\n\"I think Phillipe Clement can rightly say that they played well and he can put forward a case to the fans that his players are beginning to respond to what he wants them to do.\"\nThis video can not be played\nClement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident\nFor now, the only case Clement is putting forward is to ask why his side were not awarded a penalty in the second half.\nVaclav Cerny's shirt was tugged and his foot clipped by Scales, leading to the award of a free-kick just outside the Celtic box.\nHowever, Clement says he received \"hundreds of messages\" about the incident, suggesting the foul was on the line of the box and should have been a penalty.\n\"I don't know if you saw the images back, but my phone is overloaded with the penalty situation,\" the Rangers manager said.\n\"I've had hundreds of messages about that decisive moment. The referee cannot see that moment, but he didn't get the VAR communication to come to the screen, which is weird for me.\"\nWhat was out of sorts for McCann and fellow Sportscene pundit Scott Allan, though, was the lack of outrage from those in blue.\nMcCann was \"amazed the Rangers players weren't going berserk\", while Allan was perplexed that \"Cerny didn't make much noise himself\".\nThere were plenty of cries from the stands, dugout and pitch alike, though, when Rangers did not make the most of a four-on-one breakaway.\nCerny - having pinched possession - played through Hamza Igamane, who opted to pass to Nedim Bajrami on his right, inside of returning it to the onrushing Cerny or Mohamed Diomande on his left.\nCameron Carter-Vickers got back to block Bajrami's cross, and the chance was gone.\nClement said it was \"really disappointing that we made the wrong decision\". However, wrong moves were rare, which hasn't been the case in recent derbies.\nWhile ultimately Rangers lost their grip on the trophy, they headed down the tunnel nearly three hours after kick-off with their eyes open to future prizes."

        "content": "After signing for Manchester City in January, Juma Bah was sent on loan to French club Lens\nJuma Bah used to spend his spare time helping out at his father's bakery in Sierra Leone, but he could soon be playing for Pep Guardiola at Manchester City after a rapid footballing rise.\nBeginning his career on pitches that were often dusty or muddy in his West African homeland, just nine months ago the teenager was playing domestic league games on artificial turf.\nYet, after impressing over a dozen La Liga outings for Real Valladolid in the first half of this season, the centre-back signed for the 10-time English champions in January.\n\"It would be a dream for me to play with these great players at Manchester City,\" Bah told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"I usually play with them on PlayStation. Playing with them in real life will be amazing.\n\"I'm looking forward to go there and learn, and to have the best coach in the world. My aim is to win trophies.\"\nBah, who turns 19 next month, speaks with humility as he repeatedly stresses the need to train hard and improve his game in order to reach the top level.\nHe will certainly have to be patient before he pulls on a blue shirt.\nThe youngster was sent out on loan to Lens immediately after joining City and helped his new team-mates to an impressive 1-0 win in Marseille on Saturday as he made his first start following two brief substitute appearances for the French Ligue 1 side.\nNewly-appointed Sierra Leone boss Mohamed Kallon, who had stints at Inter Milan and Monaco as a player, has hailed the defender as a \"great prospect\".\n\"I knew something big was going to happen and he was just waiting for his opportunity,\" Kallon added.\n\"He can succeed in Europe. Manchester City bought him because they see something in him. We can see that he has potential to grow.\"\nBah began his career at Giants Academy and then had spells at AIK Freetong and Freetonians SLIFA\nBah grew up in the Congo Market neighbourhood of Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital.\nEven while he was making his first steps in football, he would carry firewood to his father Abdul Karim's bakery and also assist his mother Umu before going to training.\n\"At 4am I carried wood, because my father usually bakes early in the morning,\" Bah explained.\n\"I would say he has the best bread in the world. I used to carry the bread to people's shops.\n\"My mum used to sell chicken balls on the street. I would usually help pound the meat and after she took it to sell to people. I'm really happy to help my family.\"\nBah began playing barefoot in street games and joined AIK Freetong, a third-tier side, from his boyhood club Giant Academy in April 2021.\nJust 10 months later, before even turning 16, the defender had moved up to the Sierra Leone Premier League.\nHe established himself as a key player during a loan spell with Freetonians SLIFA, and was named the team's captain in his second season at the club.\nStanding almost 6ft 4in tall, European scouts had taken notice of his promise and, following a trial at AIK in Sweden, Bah joined Valladolid on loan last August.\nBah made a baker's dozen appearances for Real Valladolid's first team, featuring in 12 La Liga games and one match in the Copa del Rey\nAfter featuring in two under-19 matches and one game for Valladolid's second team - who play in the Spanish fourth tier - Bah was swiftly promoted to the senior squad.\nHe made his La Liga debut as a starter at home against Real Sociedad last September.\n\"It was amazing, the best day for me,\" Bah recalled of the goalless draw.\n\"I was so emotional in the dressing room and then the board came up [saying] I was going to start.\n\"When I went out I saw a lot of people in the stadium. I'd never seen this crowd before.\"\nJust over 21,000 people were in attendance, while back home Bah's mother Umu was filmed beaming with joy alongside other family members who had gathered to watch his debut on television.\n\"After the game, I saw the video and I was in tears,\" Bah said.\n\"I was like 'Oh my God' and showed my friends.\n\"I would always tell my mum that one day I was going to make her proud. Her watching me on the TV when I play was a blessing.\"\nBah became a regular in the side and, in early January, Valladolid exercised an option to sign him permanently, adding a release clause of 6m euros ($6.5m, Â£5m) in what was a youth contract.\nJust a few weeks later Bah suddenly terminated his deal, paying his buy-out fee, and subsequently joined Manchester City.\nValladolid said the move caused \"caused great disappointment and indignation\", with the Spanish club threatening legal action after accusing the reigning Premier League champions of encouraging the teenager to break his contract.\nBut Bah says he took the decision without external advice, claiming he was the lowest-paid player in the senior squad.\n\"I am the one who did that to terminate my contract,\" he said.\n\"They (Valladolid) didn't care about me. They didn't speak to my agent about giving me a new contract.\n\"They didn't even call me to speak. They didn't want me to leave because there were a lot of clubs that came to sign me.\"\nMan City accused of encouraging player to break contract\nBah has so far been an unused substitute for Sierra Leone, allowing him to train alongside the likes of experienced former Tottenham and Liverpool defender Steven Caulker (right)\nFor the time being Bah is trying to cement his place in the Lens side, while also taking French lessons.\n\"The environment is different,\" he revealed.\n\"It will take me a bit of time. Everyone in the team likes me and the players are friendly.\"\nThe next major step for Bah would be making his international debut, and Leone Stars boss Kallon has confirmed the defender is part of his plans ahead of 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers this month.\n\"Technically, he's a really good player,\" Kallon said.\n\"He can secure and protect the ball, and [he has] a good passing range. He can duel very well, dribble in tight spaces and can construct the game.\n\"That's the main qualities of a central defender.\"\nAlthough his parents have not yet travelled to Europe to watch him in action, Bah remains in regular contact.\n\"I usually speak to them on the phone every day,\" he said.\n\"That motivates me. Especially my mum. When I speak to her, I remember where I came from.\n\"This journey all these months was a blessing.\"\nBah's parents Abdul Karim - who still works in his bakery - and Umu are yet to travel to Europe to watch him in action"

BBC Action Line can direct you to help with these issues.\nFor those watching on the beach on the morning of Wednesday, 28 April 1993, the first bodies were revealed by the rising sun.\nFishermen searched in and out of creeks, divers went out in boats and a helicopter hovered overhead.\nBy lunchtime, black kit bags, wreckage and the remains of 24 of the 30 people aboard the plane had been reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean and brought ashore in Gabon. No more bodies would be found.\nSo begins a story that touched generations across two decades, laid bare a nationâs soul, and delivered triumph, just as unexpectedly as disaster.\nBwalya won two Dutch titles, under English manager Sir Bobby Robson, during his time with PSV\nFour thousand miles away, another kit bag had been packed and its owner, one of Africaâs best footballers, was preparing to go for a long run.\nKalusha Bwalya was Africaâs Player of the Year in 1988.\nEarlier that year, he had scored a hat-trick as Zambia thrashed Italy 4-0 on the way to the Olympic quarter-finals in Seoul.\nSince then, he had moved to PSV Eindhoven, partnering Brazilian great Romario up front for the reigning Dutch champions.\nBwalya and two other Europe-based players were due to meet up with their Zambia team-mates in Senegal, before the first of four qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup.\nZambia's stellar generation of players were strongly fancied to take their nation to the tournament for the first time.\nLISTEN: Amazing Sport Stories: Copper Bullets\nWith the prospect of a flight itinerary taking him from Amsterdam to Dakar via Paris, Bwalya wanted to stretch his legs and clear his mind.\nBut, before he could leave on his run, his landline rang.\nIn the early 1990s, mobile phones were a rare luxury. One Bwalya didn't have. Calls could not be ignored.\nBwalya picked up the receiver.\n\"It was the treasurer of the Football Association of Zambia,\" says Bwalya.\n\"The first thing he said to me was, âKalu, you have to delay your flight. There has been an accident.ââ\nA newspaper headline announces the deaths of the Zambia national team\nFor Zambia's population, its football team was a beacon of hope.\nThe price of copper, the country's primary export, had almost halved in the past four years, tanking the economy. Income had dropped sharply.\nPresident Frederick Chiluba had declared a national state of emergency, alleging that a coup plot against him had been uncovered.\nThe football team though were a source of pride.\nThey were known as Chipolo-polo, the Copper Bullets.\nIt was a nickname derived from Zambiaâs main industry and the team's attacking, aggressive style.\nThe team had just returned from a 3-0 win over Mauritius in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.\nThey had an eight-year unbeaten home record and were a band of brothers at the peak of their powers.\nAs far as Zambians were concerned, USA â94 was beckoning.\nTo get there they would have to top a qualification pool of three, trumping Morocco and Senegal in home-and-away ties.\nFirst up, Senegal away.\nAs usual it was a DHC-5 Buffalo military plane that would take them there.\nWith the recession eating into its funding, the football association couldnât afford commercial flights.\nInstead the DHC-5 Buffalo, an 18-year-old twin-propeller aircraft, early models of which had been used in the Vietnam War, would lumber across the vastness of Africa.\nIt was not built for long-haul trips so it would have to make regular refuelling stops.\nAnd it was showing its age. Six months earlier, while flying over the Indian Ocean en route to play Madagascar, the pilot had actually told the players to wear their life jackets.\nWhen Zambia's domestic-based players turned up to the airfield outside the capital city Lusaka to board, Patrick Kangwa, a member of the national team selection committee, met them.\nHe told 21-year-old midfielder Andrew Tembo and third-choice goalkeeper Martin Mumba that they wouldn't need to travel. They were dropped from the squad.\nPride was hurt and hot words exchanged on the tarmac.\nIt was a standard selection decision, but, on this day, it decided who would live and who would die.\nThose who did get onboard faced a daunting itinerary. The Buffalo planned to touch down and refuel in the Republic of Congo, Gabon and Ivory Coast before finally arriving in Dakar, Senegal's capital.\nIn reality, it never made it beyond Gabon.\nThe Zambian government has never released the report into what happened to the flight.\nBut in 2003, the Gabonese authorities said that almost immediately after take-off from the capital Libreville, the planeâs left-hand engine stopped working.\nThe pilot, tired from flying the team back from Mauritius the day before, shut down the right-hand engine by mistake.\nThe heavy plane, suddenly without power or lift, plunged into the ocean a few hundred metres from the Gabon coast, killing all 30 people on board.\nBack in the Netherlands, Bwalya, his run forgotten, saw the news he already knew break on television.\nâThere was a lady reading the news and the Zambian flag was behind her,\" he remembers.\n\"She said, âthe Zambian national soccer team traveling to Dakar, Senegal, for a World Cup qualifier has crashed. There are no survivorsâ.\nâAmbition - as a young person, brothers, team-mates, the spirit of the group â was lost in one day. But it seems like yesterday, itâs so clear in my mind.â\nKangwa â the official who had sent the selected players on their way in Lusaka â flew to Gabon.\nAt a stroke, his role had changed from picking players to identifying their remains.\nâThe bodies had been in the water for some time so some had started to change in state,â he says in BBC World Service podcast Copper Bullets.\nâI had to try and say, whoâs this, who can this be?\nâAfter that, I cried, we all cried. None of us thought that we would find ourselves in a place where we would see our colleagues in pieces.â\nMeanwhile, Bwalya arrived in Lusaka, where reality sank in.\n\"We went to receive the bodies, and, one by one, they took the coffins off a plane to be transported to the Independence Stadium,\" he says.\n\"That was when I realised I wonât see the team â the one I had travelled with in the same plane a few months earlier â again.\"\nOn 2 May 1993, more than 100,000 Zambians came to Independence Stadium, where Zambia played their home matches, for a funeral.\nMost of those attending stayed in the streets because the stadiumâs capacity was only 35,000.\nFollowing an all-night vigil and a service of remembrance the players were laid to rest in a semi-circle of graves.\nEach grave has a tree planted in front of it in a memorial garden called Heroesâ Acre, 100 metres to the north of the stadium.\nOne commemorated the life of the legendary Godfrey Chitalu, a fabled goalscorer who became the team's coach.\nAnother was dedicated to Bwalyaâs room-mate, David âEffortâ Chabala, who had kept the clean sheet in the Olympic demolition of Italy.\nTwenty-three year-old Kelvin Mutale was also among the dead. Two-footed, good in the air and two years into his international career, he had emerged as Bwalyaâs strike partner and had just scored all three goals in the win over Mauritius.\nâDerby Makinka was one of the best players that Zambia has ever produced in the number six position,â remembers Bwalya. âHe was a tank.\nâWe had a world-class player in every position.\nâI can still feel being in the changing room with the boys, I can still see the boys, how happy they were, and itâs a good past.\"\nBwalya pays tribute to his team-mates in Heroes' Acre. In total 30 people died in the air crash\nAmid the shock and loss, a big question loomed: what would Zambia do now?\nBwalya thought he knew.\nâI thought that Zambia was not going to play (again),â says Bwalya. âI was convinced that, there goes the ambition of us doing anything.\"\nBut, a phone call from the country's president, convinced him otherwise. The search for a new team â to be built around Bwalya â was on.\nTwenty coaches gathered in Lusaka to give trials to 60 players. A squad of disparate hopefuls was then chosen and sent to Denmark for a six-week training camp at the expense of the Danish government.\nThey were greeted at Copenhagen airport by their new, temporary coach.\nRoald Poulsen had pedigree. The 42-year-old had won both the Danish league title and cup with Odense, but his task of creating a competitive team for the World Cup qualifiers was formidable.\nâI had no clue what I was going to do,â he admits. âI had no idea about the players and no idea about the background, no idea about the society itself, anything about Zambian football.\nâI was a little bit worried when I saw the standard of the players. They didnât know whether they were good enough.â\nThe players had to adjust too. Most had never left Africa before. Poulsen had to reassure them a post-training jog through Danish forest was safe, explaining that the risk of a lion attack was lower than in Zambia.\nBwalya found a group bonded by a common purpose and sense of duty.\nâEverybody felt like they had to do something extra for the fallen heroes,â says Bwalya. âYou knew that, I am a replacement but I am doing it on behalf of somebody, Iâm stepping in for somebody.â\nOn 4 July, was their chance to step up.\nZambia held try-outs in the capital city Lusaka as they rebuilt their national side\nAlmost exactly two months after the funerals, Zambia's 1994 World Cup qualifying campaign belatedly began against Morocco in Lusaka.\nâI was with the captainâs armband and we were lining up,â remembers Bwalya.\nâI looked behind to see that everybody is in place. The first person behind me was always Effort Chabala. Now, I saw all new faces.\"\nAfter just 10 minutes, Morocco led through a spectacular goal by Rachid Daoudi. In the stands, the home fans called upon the past to help the present.\nâThe people on the upper tier that faces the memorial site turned around and they started to appeal to their deceased players, their brothers,\" remembers journalist Ponga Liwewe.\n\"They said, 'can we, with your help, get back into the game?'â\nZambia could.\nJust after the hour, Bwalya hit a magnificent equaliser from a free kick and within 10 minutes, Johnson Bwalya, no relation, won it with a second goal.\nâIt felt like we had come back from the dead,â Liwewe says.\nâThe whole nation was on its feet. We were resurrected. Thatâs an appropriate word to describe what we were feeling. We felt we can take on the world again.â\nUltimately though they would fall short of the World Cup itself.\nGoing into the final World Cup qualifier, away to Morocco in October 1993, all Zambia needed was a point to reach USA 1994.\nThey lost 1-0.\nMorocco's victory over Zambia secured their third World Cup appearance after previously qualifying for the tournaments in Mexico in 1970 and 1986\nSix months later, they surprised everyone again, but suffered once more.\nAgainst the odds, they made the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations final against Nigeria.\nElijah Litana gave Zambia the lead in the fourth minute, but two goals from the Super Eagles' Emmanuel Amunike wrestled the title out of the Copper Bullets' grasp.\nIn less than a year, Zambia had lost a team, fashioned another, and come agonisingly close to both World Cup qualification and Afcon triumph.\n\"It was a year that you had to age 10 years in order to fit in exactly what had happened,â reflects Bwalya.\nâThe fallen heroes, wherever they were, they were looking upon us and saying, âYeah, good effort. You guys are doing well. Keep going.ââ\nZambia would finish third in Afcon two years later and then retreat into obscurity for 16 years.\nZambia lost out in the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations final to a strong Nigeria, who came within a few minutes of beating eventual runners-up Italy in the last 16 at the 1994 World Cup\nZambia's squad for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations was short on star power.\nMost of the players played in their domestic league, South Africa or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Captain Chris Katongo was based in China.\nUnsurprisingly, they were 40-1 outsiders to win it.\nTheir coach was Frenchman Herve Renard, who had worked as a cleaner before breaking into football coaching. He was still to win a trophy after a decade in his new career.\nYet, they defied expectations.\nZambia topped a group containing a misfiring Senegal, saw off Sudan in the last eight, before a fine-counter-attacking performance upset Ghana in the semi-finals.\nThe final would bring them face to face with the past.\nThe tournament had co-hosts: Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. However, Zambia's path through the draw had, so far, kept them exclusively in Equatorial Guinea.\nâThe only match we were going to play in Gabon, in Libreville, was the final,â says Bwalya, by then the President of Zambia's football association.\nThe final was to be played less than 10 miles from where the 1993 team had perished off the Gabon coast.\nâI said to the coach, I think itâs better that we make a connection so that the old team meets the new team,â says Bwalya.\nâI made it known that, when we arrived, the first thing that we were going to do was visit the site.â\nThree days before the final, Bwalya, Katongo and Renard were among those who cast flowers into the surf where, two decades earlier, bodies, boots and bags had washed up.\nCaptain Chris Katongo said that the act of remembrance and tribute was \"too much\" for some of his team-mates\nâWhen we moved out from the site of the plane crash, we were in the bus and I see players quiet a little bit,â says Katongo, who was 11 in 1993.\nâEven if somebody was listening to their music, there was something (else) that he was thinking and trying to digest.\nâFrom that moment, everybody said, 'this is it guys. We just need to work as a team to achieve what these people wanted to achieve who perished here in Gabon.'â\nBwalya too could see that the playersâ mindset had shifted.\nâThe boys believed that they are not only playing for themselves, that theyâre also playing for the fallen heroes and that meant a lot more than just playing in the final.\"\nRenard's pre-match team talk did not focus on Didier Drogba, Yaya Toure or any of Ivory Coastâs other stars. It didn't focus on tactics.\nInstead, it was all about what they had experienced together on the beach.\nâThink about all the players and all the people who were in this plane and died for your country,â he told the players.\nâThink about their families, think about your country. We have to do it. We canât miss this fantastic chance.â\nThe game matched his speech for drama.\nIn the second half, with the game still scoreless, Drogba, at the peak of his Chelsea powers, smashed a penalty over the bar.\nExtra-time couldn't divide the teams either.\nBoth side converted their first seven penalties.\nBoth missed their eighth.\nZambia knelt on the pitch as they watched their team-mates take penalties\nBut finally, with a kick to win it, Zambia's Stoppila Sunzu strode to the spot.\nThe defender sang a song of praise as he prepared to start his run-up, slipped just before connecting with the ball, but still buried his shot into the bottom corner.\nHis team-mates, who had been on their knees in prayer in the centre circle, burst forward to celebrate.\nNineteen years previously, a plane had flown from Gabon to Zambia returning the dead to their final resting place.\nNow, another would made the same journey, carrying a golden trophy and a glory that transcended generations.\nZambia's triumph, less than 10 miles from where the 1993 team perished, secured the country's first, and so far only, Africa Cup of Nations\nAmazing Sport Stories: Copper Bullets\nThe stars of Zambia's national football team are killed in a deadly plane crash in 1993, and a dream is shattered.\nListen now on BBC Sounds.\nAn Olympic friendship that defied Hitler\nInside the gym building champions - and community\nChasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning\nFuelling the Tour de France: Secrets of the team kitchens"

        "content": "A concept image of the proposed site at Galgorm was released by the Irish FA on Wednesday\nThe Irish Football Association has confirmed that its new \"state-of-the-art\" National Training Centre will be located next to the Galgorm Resort, just outside Ballymena.\nIn a press release issued on Wednesday, the IFA said the facility - which is expected to open in 2028 - will \"feature world-class pitches and cutting edge training facilities\".\nThe announcement brings to an end a lengthy period of speculation about potential venues for the venture.\nThe IFA had considered basing the centre in Antrim, but said that \"no formal arrangements were ever agreed\" for the development of a 60-acre site in the Birch Hill area.\nLast month a spokesperson for the IFA told BBC News NI: \"The council were clear at all times that Birch Hill Road was under strategic consideration along with several other locations, and that exploratory discussions about the site were at preliminary stages.\n\"No formal arrangements were ever agreed and we maintain an excellent relationship with Antrim & Newtownabbey Borough Council.\"\nThe IFA said on Wednesday: \"A range of potential opportunities were explored across the country and, following a comprehensive review of all the options, Galgorm was chosen as the most compelling, best-fit opportunity to develop the facility.\"\nThe journey to Northern Ireland's national training centre\nIrish FA president Conrad Kirkwood said: \"Realising this project will significantly benefit our teams and players, creating an impressive football campus and leaving a lasting legacy for future generations.\n\"We anticipate the National Football Centre being a bespoke, world-class facility with a distinct Northern Ireland identity, serving players of all ages, both male and female, while also benefiting the local community and grassroots football.\"\nIrish FA chief executive Patrick Nelson said the project is the \"result of significant strategic thinking\".\n\"We have been able to amass capital funding over a long period to make this vision a reality, and we look forward to working with our partners at Galgorm in the coming years,\" added Nelson.\nNorthern Ireland men's team manager Michael O'Neill said the centre will help the country's international teams prepare for games \"better than ever\".\n\"It will also inspire our future international stars on their journey in football from a young age,\" said O'Neill.\n\"High-quality pitches where coaches and players can work are essential for creating a high performance environment and strong identity across all age groups.\"\nNorthern Ireland women's manager Tanya Oxtoby said: \"This initiative reaffirms our commitment to developing top-tier facilities and resources for our players.\n\"It strengthens our culture of excellence and high performance.\"\nGary McAllister, chairman of the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland Supporters' Clubs [AONISC], said \"most fans will welcome the announcement\".\n\"A first-class facility for current and future generations of Northern Ireland footballers is something every Northern Ireland fan should welcome,\" said McAllister.\n\"It's essential now that the project continues to make progress to be ready ahead of the target date of Euro 2028.\n\"Let's now see the investment in football facilities across the country from all levels of government and other stakeholders that our game has waited on for so long.\"\nStephen Watson, BBC Sport NI lead presenter\nThis is exciting news for Northern Ireland's national team managers Michael O'Neill and Tanya Oxtoby, who often hold their training camps in England, due to lack of facilities back at home.\nRemember O'Neill opted to hold his pre-Euro 2016 training camp in Carton House in Dublin, so this facility has been a long time coming.\nThe home for this new facility will be at one of Northern Ireland's luxury hotel and spas - the Galgorm Resort. Their business is expanding and they have recently acquired the Roe Park golf resort in Limavady and Galgorm castle estate for Â£28m.\nPlanning permission is still sought but it's my understanding that two training pitches will be built, and this may help attract an international team to use the facilities for a Euro 2028 training base - if Northern Ireland don't qualify.\nThere are lots of unanswered questions about how this will work, and how much funding the Stormont Executive will provide, but it's certainly a step in the right direction for international football in Northern Ireland."

        "content": "This video can not be played\nLiverpool narrowly beat PSG to put one foot in quarter-finals\n\"Of course, we are going to do it.\"\nParis St-Germain boss Luis Enrique ended his post-match interview after their remarkable defeat by Liverpool with a bit of positivity. But the feeling was he was not being entirely serious.\nPSG pummelled the Reds for 87 minutes in the Champions League last 16 first leg. Then Liverpool netted the only goal.\nLuis Enrique's side had 27 shots - the second-most on record (from 2003-04) by a side in a Champions League knockout match in which they failed to score and lost.\nUnfortunately for Luis Enrique and PSG, they also hold the record for that with 30 shots in their semi-final defeat by Borussia Dortmund last season.\nLiverpool goalkeeper Alisson, named the man of the match, had made nine saves.\nPSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma made none, conceding Liverpool's only shot on target from Harvey Elliott with three minutes to go.\nIt ended PSG's 22-game unbeaten run and 10-game winning streak in all competitions.\nLuis Enrique said: \"I don't think it's too difficult to analyse tonight's game. We were far superior to Liverpool.\n\"We created more chances and produced a complete performance against one of Europe's top sides.

Today wasn't a game based on the stats or the details.\n\"We were far superior. We didn't allow Liverpool to play.

They were much the better team today.\n\"It's a good result for us, but we felt the quality of Paris.\n\"Every underlying stat shows you they were the best side in the Champions League.

        "title": "The player who sacrificed his career for Aston Villa",
        "content": "James Chester played over 500 games during an 18 year professional career\n\"I've damaged my body indefinitely.\"\nAs Aston Villa resume their bid to reach Wembley with Friday's fifth round tie against Cardiff City, the comments of a former captain made under the arch continue to jar.\nJames Chester had just been part of the celebrations as Villa sealed a promotion to the Premier League when he told reporters the extent of his sacrifice.\nHe had played through injury for three months to avoid derailing a promotion bid. By the time Villa reached the 2019 play-off final to beat Derby County, the Wales defender was in a tracksuit having succumbed to a persistent knee problem.\nFor Villa, the six years since have seen the club go from strength to strength; from Championship to Champions League and hopes of a first FA Cup win since 1957.\nFor Chester, there were only a hundred or so further games, the majority in the lower tiers. No more Wales caps to add to his 35 that included all games in the run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. No more reaching the levels he knew he had been capable of as a central defender of calmness and quiet toughness.\nBut, after the repercussions of that decision finally led to the retirement that came a few weeks ago, no regrets either.\nEx-Villa and Hull defender Chester announces retirement\n\"It's made the last five or six years tough,\" 36-year-old Chester says. \"It's been difficult at times when some of the performances I produced were almost alien to what I was what I was used to.\n\"But when I go back to Aston Villa, it's the first topic conversation that the fans speak to me about: how grateful they are of the decision I made to continue playing.\n\"To see where the club are now, it's almost a justification for the decision I made.\"\nThe club then was in a very different place. Chester had joined Villa in the second tier in the summer of 2016. It took a while for the club to shake off frustrations and financial concerns.\nChester was almost sold to help pay bills, but he stayed on to help the team, a key man for a side containing the emerging Jack Grealish as they found their feet under Dean Smith having lost the 2018 play-off final to Fulham.\n\"We played Derby in the November and as soon as I got in the car my knee was aching,\" recalls Chester. He met up with Wales and played 50 minutes of their Nations League tie with Denmark. Unbeknown to him, it would be his final international appearance.\nThe soreness had been there a while. First a scan suggested fluid before it became apparent his cartilage was deteriorating. Every run, every bend, would aggravate the issue.\nWith Villa short of centre-backs, Chester opted to play on â at least until the January transfer window â despite the increasing pain, despite the risks, and despite eventually getting to a point it was miserable being on the pitch.\nBut, having been safely navigated through to the window, Chester had done his job. His final game of the season was an agonising one against Ipswich. Tyrone Mings arrived on loan from Bournemouth five days later. The injured captain lifted the play-off trophy in a tracksuit alongside Grealish.\nAnd yet Chester is not from Birmingham, not a boyhood Villa fan â though he says they are \"his club\" now â and had seen his old manager at Hull, Steve Bruce, sacked.\nJames Chester challenges Cristiano Ronaldo during the Euro 2016 semi-final against Portugal\nSo why put his body on the line?\n\"I think it's just the way I was brought up at home, the way we were brought up through the academy at Manchester United,\" he says. \"I'd like to think it epitomises me as a person.\n\"There's always certain clubs you play for that take a hold of you and Aston Villa did that. That first season was difficult but as soon as you walk through the door you understand the size of the club and you see the potential.\n\"The first season was difficult but the aim when I signed was to get back into the Premier League. The club was turning itself around and had a really good togetherness â and when you believe in the cause you're fighting for you're probably willing to go further.\"\nVilla did go further, but Chester eventually went elsewhere.\nHe waited 11 months before he was able to return to the pitch, playing a handful of Premier League games before moves to Stoke City, Derby and â after time without a club â eventually time in League Two with Barrow and, most recently, Salford.\nThe knee affected performances, random muscular injuries began to impact availability. While Villa fans rediscovered belief in achieving at the top, Chester found his joy when he dropped to the other end.\n\"I was probably kicking the can down the road for the last two or three years but I'm glad I did,\" he says.\n\"It gave me the opportunity to play in front of my children. I didn't see myself playing in League Two at this stage of my career, but the year at Barrow was some of the most fun and best memories the game gave me, just to remember that feelings of why you first play football.\n\"When you're in professional football for a long time you probably forget with the pressure of the clubs you play for the results required, just enjoying the game and the company you're in.\"\nPerhaps that was best illustrated as part of the 'Together Stronger' Wales group under Chris Coleman.\n\"My wife actually asked me on the day I retired what was the favourite part of my career, and I said the Euros,\" he says, before laughing that she didn't roll her eyes given most of the fans and squad of that time still happily reminisce of a summer that has become almost mythical in Welsh football.\n\"I think she was worried I was going to be an emotional state so I got a pass to talk about it. But I think everyone who shared that journey would say the same.\"\nChester admits excitement about Wales' future under Craig Bellamy, and over where his own journey leads to now. There are no plans set in stone, but he had begun a sporting director course via the PFA having been intrigued by the role and some of the decisions he's seen made through his playing days.\nHis decision to officially retire will see him stay at Salford to shadow such roles to continue his learning and â it appears â helping the club.\n\"If they get something back financially with me ending the my deal earlier with the constraint there are lower down the pyramid, then it could allow bring some players in to hopefully push the club to the next level,\" he says.\nA fitting move in keeping with that decision at Villa, the club appearing to recognise the significance of his role; he was among a select few former players to recently help model a 150th anniversary kit worn as they started their FA Cup run with a third round win over West Ham.\n\"I'd hope so,\" he laughs when asked if he'd be able to get a ticket for Wembley if Villa went all the way. \"I was at the fourth round (against Tottenham) too so perhaps I'm a lucky omen!\n\"I'm not saying that we as a squad thought that within five years the club would be in the Champions League knock-out stages,\" he adds.\n\"But, once you play for them, you can see the potential the club has and it's nice to see them fulfilling that. They've been incredibly well run and, to see where the club is now, I'm incredibly proud of the part I've played.\""

        "content": "Jim Goodwin, Rocky Bushiri and Elton Kabangu feature on Sunday\nThe big games keep on coming in the Scottish Premiership, but the main interest lies away from the top two on Sunday after Celtic extended their lead after beating St Mirren on Saturday while Rangers stumbled again at home to Motherwell.\nOn Sunday, it is the turn of the four other sides in the top six to meet as Hibernian host the Edinburgh derby with Heart of Midlothian and Dundee United visit Aberdeen.\nHere are some key points to watch out for.\nFamiliar frailties for Ferguson in Ibrox homecoming\nRodgers hails 'one of my favourite results' as Celtic thump St Mirren\nMotherwell win to ruin Ferguson's Ibrox return\nAfter horrendous starts to the league season, Hibs stuck by their head coach while city rivals Hearts changed theirs. Both strategies appear to have worked.\nWhen the sides drew 1-1 at Easter Road in October, three games after Neil Critchley succeeded the sacked Steven Naismith, they remained tied on points at the foot of the table, with Hibs rock bottom on goal difference.\nFew at the time would have fancied the chances of either finishing the season in third place.\nAfter Hibs won 2-1 at Tynecastle on Boxing Day, Hearts were still stuck in second bottom, while the visitors' win merely lifted them five points clear of the relegation play-off spot, albeit up to seventh.\nHowever, Sunday's derby has switched from being a relegation dogfight into a race to secure a place in the top half, with Hibs having moved up to fourth and Hearts to sixth - for the first time since August - after both enjoyed 3-1 wins in midweek.\nIndeed, both will have their sights set firmly on catching an Aberdeen side who have regained third spot after ending a dismal spell of their own but suffered a 5-1 thumping away to leaders Celtic on Tuesday.\nHearts, though, cannot afford to slip up this time as they head to the other side of Edinburgh Castle, considering they are four points behind Hibs and Dundee United - and a further point adrift of the Dons.\nCritchley's side have suffered just one defeat - to second-top Rangers - in 12 outings and are seven unbeaten on the road.\nHowever, David Gray's hosts are on an even more impressive unbeaten run of 14, winning 10 of them, eight of those at Easter Road.\nA derby cracker would appear assured after Hibs and Hearts displayed their new-found resilience by coming back from a goal down to beat United and St Mirren, respectively, on Wednesday.\nHibs have home advantage, but Hearts have only lost one of their latest 10 visits to Easter Road, have not lost successive games to their city rvials since 2009 and were the side to end Hibs' run the last time they went 12 league games unbeaten in 2018.\nElton Kabangu has spearheaded Hearts' recent revival\nWith seven goals in eight games since arriving on loan from Union Saint-Gilloise, Elton Kabangu has been instrumental in Hearts' mid-season push.\nThe 27-year-old Belgian-born forward had not scored in 11 outings this season for his parent club before heading to Tynecastle in January.\nHowever, Kabangu has found a new lease of life in Edinburgh and will provide a stern test for the defensive stability that has been the foundation of Hibs' own recovery when he goes head to head with in-form compatriot Rocky Bushiri at the heart of the home defence.\nIt is not long since Jim Goodwin was being hailed for the job he has done in lifting United out of the Championship and into the Premiership's top six.\nEverything looked rosey when they overtook Aberdeen into third spot, but after one win in seven, including four straight defeats, they find themselves in fifth, a point behind the Dons again as they visit Pittodrie on Sunday.\nHibs' 3-1 win at Tannadice on Wednesday also lifted the resurgent Edinburgh side above United on goal difference and the battle for third is suddenly a three-team race - and maybe a fourth with Hearts only four points further back.\nGoodwin and his team were left smarting from a Sam Dalby's disallowed goal when the score was 1-1, with the club requesting an explanation from the Scottish FA - and publication of the VAR conversation - about the decision.\nHaving had an unhappy experience as Aberdeen boss, Goodwin will also be particularly keen to get his side back on track at Pittodrie, where they have lost three of their latest four visits, drawing the other, since a 3-0 Scottish Cup win in April 2021.\nThe latest was a 1-0 defeat in October, but United reversed that scoreline at Tannadice in final game of 2024 and, since then, no side has lost more top-flight games or scored fewer goals than Aberdeen.\nShould United head down the A90 with three points, they will have enjoyed back-to-back league victories over the Dons for the first time since November 2008 under Craig Levein and Goodwin's side will have re-emphasised their European qualification credentials."

It's important for us to build some consistency and finish the season strongly,\" said Whiteley.\n\"It's important to give us a platform to work on. It's also important for the fans. We want to produce football that they enjoy watching and want to get behind.\n\"I think we can do that in the next couple of months. There is lots to play for.\"\nLiverpool's recruitment process is already under way as they look to appoint a permanent manager but Whiteley said she will \"throw her name in the hat\".\nShe has climbed up the ranks at Liverpool and was previously the head coach of the under-21s, before her first interim spell in charge in 2021.\nShe expects to be in temporary charge again until the end of the season but could Whiteley follow in the footsteps of Sunday's opponent Renee Slegers, who proved her worth in an interim spell at Arsenal before being offered the permanent job?\n\"It's definitely a role I'm interested in and will put in for. But that recruitment process goes to one side and I have to focus on the day-to-day,\" said Whiteley.\n\"From my interim period previously, the biggest thing I took away was that I was capable of doing the job.\n\"I am in a far better position having had the time with Matt [Beard] and working under him.\n\"When these opportunities come about, you have to stand up and show exactly what you are capable of.

It's made me be a lot more open-minded, that's for sure,\" said Whiteley.\n\"I have seen a completely different way of doing things which has been great. Matt is very tactically astute, very flexible in his approach.\"\nWhiteley's approach, she described, will be \"more measured\" against Arsenal but she hopes to bring out Liverpool's attacking threats going forward.\nAsked what she could personally bring to the table during this period, Whiteley added: \"I think I am a strong leader, very self-aware and very reflective.\n\"I probably listen more than what I speak - but when I do speak, I give it some real thought and consideration.\n\"I'm really good at bringing people together and empowering those I work with.\""

        "content": "Serhou Guirassy has scored 54 goals since the start of last season\nSerhou Guirassy - a man with a modest career until two years ago - finds himself near the top of the Champions League goalscoring charts.\nThe 28-year-old Borussia Dortmund striker has relegations from the German and French top tiers on his CV - and had never hit a 15-goal season until last season.\nHis six transfers in a journeyman, often injury-hit, career have cost a combined Â£45m.\nBut now the Guinea international is the Champions League's joint-second top scorer, with 10 goals, going into the last-16 second leg against Lille - a club who previously moved him on after just six months.\nBBC Sport looks at the remarkable rise of Guirassy - who has been linked with a host of British clubs throughout his career.\nGuirassy (centre) played for France at U16, U17 and U19 level - scoring 12 goals in 24 games\nGuirassy, then a France Under-19 international, made his first-team breakthrough at Laval and scored six goals in 29 games in the 2014-15 Ligue 2 campaign.\nQPR and Leeds were both linked to him before he moved to Lille that summer for a reported 1m euros (now Â£840,000).\nHerve Renard was the manager who brought him to Lille - but was sacked in November and, after only three Ligue 1 starts, Guirassy was sent on loan to second tier Auxerre in January.\nHe netted eight goals in 16 games but Lille - who host Dortmund on Wednesday after a 1-1 first-leg draw - sold him that summer.\nGuirassy netted nine goals in 45 games for Cologne\nArsenal, still managed by Arsene Wenger then, were reportedly scouting him during that loan spell to Auxerre.\nBut instead he moved to Cologne - in a somewhat protracted deal.\nThe German side spotted something in his medical and the clubs had a minor war of words before Cologne eventually negotiated a lower fee - understood to be about 4m euros (now Â£3.4m).\nInjuries would blight his time there and he managed just 21 Bundesliga appearances, and four goals, in his first two seasons before their relegation.\nAccording to Transfermarkt he has missed 75 games through injury or illness in his career, with 41 of them coming during his time at Cologne.\nHe netted just two goals in the opening half of the 2018-19 German second tier season before returning to France to join Amiens on loan.\nGuirassy played for Rennes against Leicester in the 2021-22 Conference League - and has been linked to the Foxes\nGuirassy netted three Ligue 1 goals in the second half of 2018-19 and Amiens paid about 5m euros (about Â£4.2m now) to sign him permanently that summer.\nWest Ham, Aston Villa, Leicester, Bournemouth, Brighton and Tottenham were all reportedly interested in signing him midway through the 2019-20 season - but he ended up staying at Amiens as they were relegated to Ligue 2.\nAmiens sports director John Williams says Guirassy turned down a move to Chelsea in the summer of 2020 because he wanted first-team guarantees - so instead he moved to French top-flight Rennes for about 15m euros (now Â£12.6m).\nHe hit double figures for the first two times in his career in all competitions with 25 goals in two seasons - but a return to Germany was calling.\nEverton were the latest British team to be linked to him when he was leaving Rennes in 2022 - and were supposedly close to signing him at one stage.\nBut instead he went back to the Bundesliga, joining Stuttgart in a loan deal.\nHe scored 14 goals in all competitions, including one in the promotion-relegation play-off win over Hamburg, as he avoided a third relegation in his career.\nStuttgart made the signing permanent for a fee of about 9m euros (now Â£7.6m).\nAnd then his career really got going.\nThe 2023-24 season was the year Guirassy really found his shooting boots.\nIn all competitions last season he netted 30 goals in 30 games for Stuttgart - in an injury-hit campaign.\nHe netted 28 Bundesliga goals in as many games - one every 79 minutes - and only missed out on the Golden Boot to Harry Kane's 36.\nStuttgart finished second in the table behind Bayer Leverkusen.\nGuirassy was unfortunate because without Kane, he would have won not only the German top-scorer award but also the European Golden Shoe - awarded to the leading scorer across Europe's top leagues.\nDespite missing several games through injury, he played 2,211 minutes in the league (equivalent to 24.5 full games) - the most in his career.\nIt was at Stuttgart too that he became a senior international for Guinea, having represented France at youth level.\nGuirassy has scored Champions League goals against Club Brugge, Celtic, Dinamo Zagreb, Barcelona, Bologna, Shakhtar and Sporting\nManchester United and Newcastle United were among the English teams to be linked to him last summer.\nBut he instead moved to Borussia Dortmund, who triggered a release clause to sign him for 17.5m euros (Â£14.7m).\nAnother injury delayed his debut but he has been prolific since getting into the team - with 24 goals in 34 games.\nTen of those have come in the Champions League, in his debut season in Europe's top competition, where he has outscored everyone apart from Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane (10) and Barcelona's Raphina (11).\n\"I understand that my form might surprise some, but I'm not surprised,\" he said recently., external\n\"I have had two crazy seasons, but I've not changed anything. I'm not working more, I'm not sleeping more, I'm not doing more video analysis.\n\"It's just a question of confidence. And I have understood that at the highest level, talent isn't enough.\n\"You have to push through the pain barrier in challenges, in the effort you put in, in making high-intensity runs again and again, more quickly and more frequently than your opponents.\n\"Perhaps that is where the change has come from.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

        "title": "From wonderkid to father figure - how Ampadu leads Leeds",
        "content": "Ethan Ampadu was named Leeds captain aged just 23 but has built vast experience since making his debut as a 15-year-old\nAt the age of just 24, Ethan Ampadu has led a nomadic career, with four loan destinations that can sometimes become part of being a young footballer at Chelsea.\nBut last summer was the first post-season in five years where the Wales international didn't have to pack any bags.\nSigned by Leeds United 12 months previously, he helped form the foundations on which Daniel Farke is building their push for automatic promotion, following defeat by Southampton in the play-off final last season.\nBeyond Ampadu's talents and versatility was his growing leadership and dressing room presence, honed over the seven different professional clubs that make up his varied CV.\nThat led to Farke giving Ampadu the captaincy at 23. He described the \"honour\" as giving him a sense of \"home\", albeit with a level of responsibility he admitted is \"not easy\" to handle.\n'More records will have to fall for Leeds to go up'\n'Always goes to the wire' - Farke calls for calm\nPortsmouth end leaders Leeds' 17-game unbeaten run\nAmpadu made his professional debut aged 15 years, 10 months and 26 days against Brentford in the EFL Cup for League Two side Exeter City in 2016.\nHis big transfer to Chelsea came just 12 months later. A series of four loans to RB Leipzig, Sheffield United, Venezia and Spezia each arrived with their own challenges, whether they were culture, language, tactical differences or situation.\nAmpadu became the fastest player to 50 Wales caps last year, with former manager Rob Page saying he is a \"future captain\" for his country.\n\"I feel like I've found a home, and hopefully I can show that in performances and in the way I am as a person. I feel like those things I've experienced and lived through, I've had to mature quite early,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"I've lived in a few different places, experienced different cultures and see how people conduct themselves in those professional environments.\n\"Being trusted at 15 to play and perform to get results, I guess that's one way I've had to mature. But also just being around people who are older than me for a large part of my development plays a part in it as well.\n\"I feel like I can come across as mature because of how I've been raised, but I'm sure if you were to ask a few of the boys around the training ground, they'll probably still say I'm 24.\"\nFormer Wales captains Gareth Bale and Ashley Williams are cited as major influences, as are Chelsea legend Cesar Azpilicueta and former Leeds centre-back Liam Cooper, who was his captain last season.\nBut his father Kwame Ampadu, a former footballer who coached him at Exeter, is \"the first person I look up to\", but \"also someone I butt heads with as a player talking to a coach\".\nThat influence his father passed onto him inspires his next steps, away from football, as Ampadu became a father himself in 2022.\nEthan Ampadu made 13 appearances for Exeter before signing for Chelsea\n\"I've got a little boy, so if I can pass on and influence him to become the man that I'd like him to become - and that he wants to become when he's older - definitely. That's a really big part of my life at the moment,\" he added.\nIt is rare for Ampadu to conduct a media appearance away from football, but he was offering support to Green Football's Great Save,, external donating his first shirt as Leeds captain in a surprise appearance at a charity shop in Ripon in North Yorkshire.\n\"I feel like it is a time where I can portray my message,\" he added. \"Even if it's just to one person, just to be able to influence one person and benefit the environment - that would be really good.\n\"I'm not an expert and may never be but what I want to show is that I am learning. There's this figure -100,000 tons of sportswear end up in landfill every year - so it is about showing how to impact the environment in a positive way.\"\nAmpadu is currently out with a knee injury but hopes to return in time to help boost Leeds' title push in a fierce automatic promotion battle with Sheffield United and Burnley.\n\"It's the run-in,\" he said. \"There's three top teams at the minute that are all fighting for the same thing - four, if you want to include Sunderland as well. But for us, we've got full confidence in what we can achieve.\n\"We're fighting to be at the top of the league. I don't know who wouldn't enjoy that. It'd be silly not to. And whilst we're in it, we're going to try and enjoy every moment of it.\""

        "title": "How much do Premier League clubs make from tickets?",
        "content": "Football fans - including Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford last weekend - have protested against rising ticket prices this season\nFootball fans can be tribal. But when it comes to ticket prices, there is unity.\n\"We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices,\" said Manchester United Supporters' Trust CEO Duncan Drasdo.\n\"Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.\"\nWhen 19 of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.\nThose protests have grown again this season, with some clubs removing concessionary discounts for the elderly and young people - and teams like Arsenal announcing increases for 2025-26.\nThe cost of competing for trophies, increasing operational expenses, and the threat of complying with financial regulations, have all been given as reasons for price hikes.\nBBC Sport has analysed a new Uefa report showing the league's financial power and how much clubs make from tickets - but also the challenge of increased staffing levels and expensive running costs.\nThis video can not be played\nArsenal fan Laura Kirk-Francis outlines her disappointment over ticket price hikes\nPremier League clubs made a total of almost 1bn euros (Â£830m) from selling tickets to home matches in 2023, Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report shows.\nThat figure is growing by about 10% per year, and is almost double that of Spain's  La Liga (Â£481m) and Germany's Bundesliga (Â£430m).\nThe report uses a mixture of full financial reporting of more than 700 clubs for 2023, plus 2024 figures from 130 of Europe's biggest clubs.\nOf the 10 clubs who generated the most income from gate receipts in 2024, six are English.\nThe same six Premier League clubs feature in the top 12 for another ticketing metric, which measures the money earned per fan, per ticket.\n\"What the figures show is that English top-flight clubs are doing very well financially in a whole number of different metrics,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the FSA.\n\"Healthy ticket revenue shows people are wanting to go - but also shows the ratcheting up of ticket prices in the past few years. That is manifesting itself in the protests and disenchantment we've seen.\"\nThe report also points out that \"stadium expansions and/or increases in premium seating and hospitality have also doubled gate revenues at Paris St-Germain, Bayern [Munich], Liverpool and Manchester City since 2009\".\nArsenal and Tottenham's positions are helped by sales of high-value hospitality seats at modern stadiums in London - one of the world's most-visited cities.\n\"What we have seen clubs do through stadium expansion is a huge focus on those seats being hospitality,\" says Dan Plumley, senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University.\n\"On a basic financial level it makes sense, because you can generate more from that than a baseline seat.\n\"But if that is stopping your more average fan getting a ticket, that is something clubs are going to have to grapple with.\"\nThe report states the average amount made per fan from tickets is Â£29-Â£37 \"for the majority of clubs\".\nFans from four rival clubs to protest at ticket prices\nMan Utd fans criticise ticket prices - as club reveals manager change costs\nPremier League ticket price rises - what the fans think\nThis video can not be played\nOne Manchester United fan explains why protests are planned\nThe Uefa report paints a similar picture to other research such as the annual Deloitte Money League - with Premier League clubs bringing in far more revenue  (Â£6.2bn in 2023) than other European leagues.\nHowever, English clubs reported a combined loss of Â£728m before tax.\nTV rights deals are showing signs of plateauing, so clubs need to maximise matchday income and commercial and sponsorship revenues to try to offset significant spending on transfers, wages and running costs in order to turn a profit.\nThe report outlines some eye-watering spending figures:\nPremier League clubs spent Â£4bn on player wages in 2023, almost double second-placed Spain (Â£2.1bn).\nFour European clubs have squads that cost more than 1bn euros (Â£830m) to assemble by the end of 2024, and all are English - Chelsea (1.7bn euros/Â£1.4bn), Manchester City (1.3bn euros/Â£1.1bn), Manchester United (1.1bn euros/Â£920m), and Arsenal (1bn euros/Â£840m).\nChelsea's 2024 squad was found to be \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record - the 2020 Real Madrid squad. The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (Â£1.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (Â£53m), Borussia Dortmund (Â£41m), Lazio (Â£34m), Leipzig (Â£31m), Eintracht Frankfurt (Â£27m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (Â£164m), Chelsea (Â£93m), Aston Villa (Â£84m), Roma (Â£63m), Liverpool (Â£55m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting.\nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of Â£1.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost Â£500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of Â£1bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says.\n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\""

        "content": "This video can not be played\n'I don't think VAR can overrule that'\nCeltic and Dundee United's disallowed goals in Scottish Premiership defeats by Hibernian last month should have stood, according to Scottish FA head of refereeing Willie Collum.\nCollum also believes St Mirren should have been awarded a penalty in their league loss to Celtic.\nOn 22 February, Daizen Maeda thought he had levelled for Celtic following Alistair Johnston's cut-back at Easter Road, but a video assistant referee (VAR) review resulted in a goal-kick being awarded.\nThe ball was ruled to have gone out of play before the right-back's delivery in a game Celtic ultimately lost 2-1.\nAt Tannadice on 26 February, and with the score at 1-1, Sam Dalby was ruled to have used an arm to net against Hibs, who went on to win the game 3-1.\nSpeaking about the Maeda incident on the SFA's latest edition of The VAR Review, Collum said: \"You need 100% conclusive evidence to disallow the goal here and prove that the ball is over the goal line and, in this case, that's not possible.\nThis video can not be played\n'It's astonishing' why St Mirren were denied penalty\n\"It's not possible to prove categorically that the ball has crossed the goalline fully.\n\"On this occasion, we expect the on-field decision to be supported and a goal awarded.\"\nOn Dalby, Collum added: \"Do we have 100% conclusive evidence of the ball striking the arm? And we don't, so therefore the on-field decision should be supported. We need to be categorical, we need to be clear.\"\nWhen St Mirren hosted Celtic on 1 March, Johnston was ruled to have challenged Roland Idowu fairly as the visitors led 3-2, with the Premiership leaders going on to win 5-2.\nHowever, Collum said: \"For us, this is a penalty kick. This is a reckless challenge.\n\"The outcome here should've been penalty kick and yellow card.\"\nBut Collum supported the decisions to not award penalties for handball for Dundee against Motherwell in the Premiership on 26 February, and for St Mirren against Heart of Midlothian on 10 February in the Scottish Cup.\nHe also backed the VAR-awarded spot-kick for Celtic in their 5 February 6-0 league win over Dundee - and the downgrading of Hamza Igamane's red card to a yellow card in Rangers' 2-0 loss to St Mirren on 22 February.\nAn incident in Hearts' 3-1 league loss to Rangers on 16 February was also discussed.\nThere was a coming together in Rangers' penalty box between defender Clinton Nsiala and Hearts' forward James Wilson shortly before the visitors scored their second goal.\nVAR was not called upon to review the Nsiala challenge and Collum said: \"We are content with this decision.\"\nHowever, Collum felt Killian Phillips should have been sent off against Hearts in St Mirren's Premiership defeat on 26 February.\nThe midfielder was initially sent off for an elbow on Jamie McCart, but the on-field decision was downgraded to a yellow on review.\nCollum believed Phillips' challenge merited a red card, even though it was not an elbow.\nCeltic's Maeda 'wrongly denied equaliser against Hibs'"

The one-time wonderkid left to train alone in a concrete wilderness of city towerblock staircases. A cage footballer for hire, a pick-up game artist on speed dial. The embers of his professional dream still flickering in a footballing underworld.\nKevin Gonzalez Quintero was once Jude Bellingham's England room-mate, played in the same youth teams as Jamal Musiala and Harvey Elliott and was the guy a young Jhon Duran would ask for boots.\n\"Jude, he is a great lad,\" remembers Kego. \"He is very chill, a great person on and off the pitch. You can see why he is where he is today. Since that very young age he has had that leadership. Very mature.\"\nHis father once played for Deportivo Cali, but Kego's parents packed up and left a Colombia that he says was in the grip of Pablo Escobar and the nation's drug cartels to swap South America for a new life in south London before he was born.\nThat allowed Kego to shine in front of Crystal Palace scouts, joining the Eagles aged eight and later winning their academy player of the year.\nAfter a decade with Palace he believed he was destined for the Premier League and life on the international stage. As well as England, Kego represented Colombia at youth level.\n\"It was a dream,\" he says. \"I always wanted to play for Colombia. Duran was there with me. He is a funny guy.\n\"He has always been good, but he wasn't banging in goals like that. Which shows his dedication, his time. It worked out for him. I'm very happy for him, too. He deserves it, I saw how hard it was for him.\n\"I remember him asking me for football boots. Just seeing him now is like 'wow, you have grown so much and I am proud of you, man'.\"\nThose players have gone on to represent some of the world's biggest clubs - Bellingham at Real Madrid, Musiala at Bayern Munich and Elliott at Liverpool, while former Aston Villa striker Duran is making his fortune in Saudi Arabia.\nBut for Kego, it didn't work out like that.\nHe was released by Palace at 18 and, via false dawns and broken promises, spent four years travelling the world, trialling in 14 different countries, yearning for a professional contract.\n\"I thought I was going to have the world at my feet,\" says the now 22-year-old. \"I played with Colombia, I played with England. I was at Palace for 10 years. I was pretty sure I'd get a club, easily, but then I got exposed to the real world, quickly.\"\nJamal Musiala and Kego on England youth team duty\nSo what went wrong for Kego at Crystal Palace? He was offered an extension, he says, but it did not materialise.\n\"I got different advice that I shouldn't have listened to,\" recalls Kego. \"Two months later, they just told me 'Look, Kevin, we're not going to guarantee you any game time for next year, you're better off looking for other teams. You're a very good player, we believe you can start your professional career elsewhere'.\n\"I was very down, 10 years here and then just like that, gone.\n\"A few agents, they lied to me. Saying 'listen, we have got this club for you and this club'. They sell you the world. But when it came to the time, nothing happened. That was really upsetting.\"\nHe was caught in a spiral of failed trials and wasted journeys - Hungary, Spain, even Brazil.\n\"Before you know it, you're six months without a club, then a year, then it carries on going,\" adds Kego. \"They start questioning your ability. Often I heard from clubs 'Oh, but he's been out for six months, oh, two years now'.\n\"Then when I did get the chance, I would be so mentally drained, to the point I couldn't focus. And when I was there, there would be another agent telling me 'listen, I've got you a first-team game'.\n\"I went to another team in Spain. The agent sorted the travel and everything, but when I got there, he blocked me. I didn't hear from him again and I was left stranded.\"\nAt the same time, his mum became seriously ill and needed the support of Kego and his father.\n\"Seeing your mum, the person that raised you, when she's ill, that kills you as a son,\" he says. \"She is still recovering, she has days that are good and days that are bad. We are getting there.\"\nKego with Xavi Simons, now of RB Leipzig and the Netherlands, after a youth match against Barcelona\nKego with the Colombia Under-17s squad\n1 of 2\nTo stay prepared for an opportunity, Kego would train relentlessly on his own.\n\"It almost felt like a prison cell,\" he explains. \"You wake up, you train, you see the same surroundings over and over again. Four years, the same thing.\n\"I would wake up, I would see bricks, blocks. It's mad. Going from seeing grass, everything is cut for you, you have got new balls - now I am maybe playing with a flat football, playing with a tennis ball or a golf ball.\n\"It's called the towerblock in my area. Every day I would be running up the stairs, training with my dad. I would even go to the park, on an 11-a-side pitch, I would start passing the ball to imaginary team-mates and then I would go and chase after the ball myself. It wasn't easy, but you have to work with what you have.\"\nBut it was not just a physical battle. He could eat well and run until the sun came up - and friends say they would get calls at 4am to do just that - but mentally, with no end in sight, the churn was taxing.\n\"When you're not at a team you're getting frustrated because you know your talent, you know that you can do that, that you're a good player, you have played with the best before,\" says Kego. \"Mentally it is killing you.\"\nKego says he went \"deep inside my mind\". He tried new things - he practises Simran meditation and, as a Christian, studies the Bible and prays.\nBut he also found salvation on the streets, with a ball at his feet.\n\"Street football is what gives you that tempo,\" he beams. \"Short spaces. You have got to think quick. It really helped me. It gave me a lot of confidence. I was like 'you know what, if I can do it in this short space, imagine a bigger space'.\"\nKego built a reputation in cage tournaments and pick-up games, becoming renowned in street football circles and even earning a deal with Puma.\n\"Everyone knew if they wanted to win with style, call him,\" laughs Gundeep Anand, the founder of street football tournament The Last Stand.\nIt was in one such tournament Kego was spotted by Spanish side UD Ibarra, and suddenly the dream was revived.\nKego earned a glowing reputation on the street football scene, playing in tournaments such as The Last Stand\nDiego Maradona Jr is the head coach of Spanish side UD Ibarra, who play on the island of Tenerife\nIbarra, from Tenerife, play in the fifth tier but are pushing for promotion and showing ambition. They recently appointed Diego Maradona Jr as head coach.\n\"He passed the ball to me and I said 'what, wait, [it's like] his dad is passing the ball to me',\" Kego remembers of their first meeting on the training pitch. \"It's a bit mad. I was watching his dad's YouTube videos and then his son is passing the ball to me.\n\"The way they walk, they have a similar look. It's very motivating.\"\nThe forward is waiting to make his debut and Maradona Jr is keen to see the youngster kickstart his career in the Canary Islands.\n\"We needed a player like him,\" he says. \"Quick. Good technically, and had some experience in professional teams like Crystal Palace, the Colombian national team.\n\"He can bring speed to the game.  A player who can score many goals and who understands the game.\n\"We hope he can bring a different mentality that we are trying to change with the team and the club.\"\nKego describes joining Ibarra as \"relief\". Now, he says, \"it's time to shine\".\n\"I was buzzing, excited, very emotional as well,\" he adds.\n\"All these years of work, I would never have thought I would make it pro at 22. If I'm honest, I said let me just dedicate myself to playing street football.\"\nThat is one dream accomplished, but what comes next?\n\"I always think big,\" he smiles. \"Short term is smash it here, do my best, focus and try and get many goals and get the club promotion.\n\"Longer term... I want to be the best player in the world one day.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast"

        "content": "Omer Riza's Cardiff City welcome Matt Bloomfield's Luton Town for one of four crucial midweek games involving teams at the bottom of the Championship\nJust like that, there are only 10 games remaining of the Championship season and the finishing line is coming into view.\nAnother line coming into sharp focus in the midweek round of fixtures is the dotted one at the bottom end of the table.\nA cluster of teams are trying to either clamber above the drop zone or keep their distance from danger - and six of them go head-to-head on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThere are also some potentially season-defining encounters across the rest of the EFL in League One and League Two.\nMatt Bloomfield has won one of his 10 league games (W1 D3 L6) since taking over as Luton Town boss\nIf ever there was a six-pointer, Luton Town's trip to fellow relegation battlers Cardiff City on Tuesday most definitely falls into that category.\nThe Hatters are five points adrift of safety in 23rd following their 4-0 thrashing at Burnley on Saturday, while the Bluebirds are four points above the bottom three in 21st.\nVictory for Luton would close the gap to two points, while defeat would see it extend to eight, underpinning just how important the outcome to this one could prove to be.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the predicament they find themselves in, neither side are in flying form in the league, with Cardiff winning one of their past seven games and Luton tasting victory once in their previous 14 (W1 D3 L10).\nHome advantage might just give Cardiff the edge against a side that has won once on the road this season (W1 D2 L15) and is facing the prospect of consecutive relegations.\nJohn Eustace won his first game as Derby County boss against former club Blackburn Rovers on Saturday\nDerby County ended their miserable 12-game winless run with a crucial 2-1 victory over head coach John Eustace's previous club Blackburn Rovers on Saturday to put them within four points of safety in 22nd.\nThe Rams could not face a tougher challenge on Tuesday though, as they welcome the Championship's most in-form team.\nFifth-placed Coventry City's 3-2 win against Stoke City at the weekend means they have now won nine of their past 10 games - although seven of Derby's eight wins this season have come at Pride Park.\nVictory for Derby would give them back-to-back wins for the first time since September, and could put them within one point of safety, depending on Cardiff's result against Luton.\nPlymouth have scored two goals in five league games since beating Millwall 5-1 on 12 February\nPortsmouth's excellent 1-0 victory over leaders Leeds United on Sunday - to make it four wins from five - might just have put them on the brink of excluding themselves from the relegation battle conversation.\nThey are now 10 points clear of the bottom three in 17th, and the objective of staying safe in their first season back in the Championship for 12 years is so nearly complete.\nAs for their visitors Plymouth Argyle, the picture is looking bleaker with every passing week.\nTwo league wins in a row over West Bromwich Albion and Millwall had put Miron Muslic's side within one point of safety, but a run of five games without victory since then has seen them slip back to the foot of the table and six points adrift of the cut-off mark.\nThe Pilgrims have not won away from home all season (D5 L13) and a trip to Fratton Park - where Portsmouth have lost once in their past 12 (W9 D2 L1) - does not look the most inviting.\nIt is getting into do-or-die territory for Plymouth if they are to avoid a return to League One two years after winning promotion.\nHull City have picked up 22 points in 17 games under Ruben Selles, compared to 15 points from 17 matches when Tim Walter was in charge\nA run of one defeat in their past five (W2 D2 L1) has helped Hull City drag themselves up to 19th and five points clear of danger, having sat in the bottom three one month ago.\nThey welcome an Oxford United side on Wednesday night who have been sliding in the wrong direction and could be sucked back into the survival scrap.\nSince a new manager bounce under Gary Rowett helped the U's string together a nine-game unbeaten run, they have lost four of their past six and are now 18th, seven points clear of Derby in 22nd.\nVictory for the Tigers would move them above Oxford, while a first win in nine games for the visitors could provide some timely respite and breathing space.\nSheffield United have won nine of their past 11 games to maintain their push for automatic promotion\nAt the top end of the Championship, the race to win automatic promotion to the Premier League has tightened up once again.\nTwo points separate Leeds United and Sheffield United in the top two from Burnley in third.\nThe Clarets take on West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday and will be looking to extend their unbeaten run to 24 games.\nSheffield United host Bristol City, while Leeds welcome Millwall on Wednesday hoping to bounce back from a first defeat in 18 at Portsmouth.\nTwo straight wins for Sunderland has kept their faint hopes of automatic promotion just about alive, and they sit eight points off the top two ahead of the visit of Preston North End.\nSteven Schumacher has won five of his first seven league games as Bolton Wanderers boss\nThe old adage in football suggests that a side who can hit a decent run of form heading into the play-offs often goes on to win promotion.\nWell, if Bolton Wanderers can continue in the same vein for their remaining 11 games in League One, they will certainly fancy their chances.\nThe Trotters have won seven of their past nine games (W7 D1 L1) since Ian Evatt was sacked on 22 January to move into sixth, two points above Huddersfield Town in seventh with a game in hand.\nNew boss Steven Schumacher has guided Bolton on a six-game unbeaten run, following on from the good work done by interim boss Julian Darby, who won both league games he took charge of.\nVictory at Bristol Rovers on Tuesday could lift them above Stockport County and as high as fourth, depending on how fifth-placed Charlton Athletic get on at Crawley Town.\nFive of the top nine in League Two are in action on Tuesday night\nThe pendulum seems to swing one way and then the other every week in the race for promotion in League Two.\nThat is set to happen again with some vital games at the top on Tuesday as four sides hoping to go up lock horns.\nNotts County, who are fifth and have picked up one win in six games, welcome eight-placed Grimsby Town, who will move into the play-off spots with a draw.\nPort Vale travel to in-form Colchester United as sixth takes on ninth with both sides unbeaten in their past 11 games.\nMeanwhile, AFC Wimbledon, who were the only team in the top seven to win at the weekend, could move above Doncaster Roves into the automatic promotion spots if they beat Cheltenham Town at home."

        "title": "Missed opportunity as trophy pressure grows on Arteta",
        "content": "This video can not be played\nArteta 'very frustrated' at result against Man Utd\nMikel Arteta's 200th Premier League game as Arsenal manager was not so much a celebration as a wake for another title challenge that fell short.\nArsenal's nearly men produced another nearly performance in the 1-1 draw at Manchester United, a display that was so much of their season in microcosm, leaving them needing binoculars to see Liverpool, who lead the table by 15 points.\nThe Gunners weaved pretty patterns around Old Trafford with their 68.2% possession, but barely landed a serious blow on a United side short on quality and shorn of confidence until Declan Rice's crisp 74th-minute strike levelled Bruno Fernandes' trademark free-kick, which came in first-half stoppage time.\nArsenal have been fading for weeks, the failure to sign a recognised striker exposed as a flawed strategy, with injuries to Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz compounding the absence of key figure Bukayo Saka.\nAnd their failed transfer policy came into sharp relief at Old Trafford when, with Arteta's side needing a winning goal to keep even their wafer-thin title chances alive, he turned to full-back Kieran Tierney, who is leaving for Celtic at the end of the season, rather than forward Raheem Sterling.\nSterling was a last-minute signing in the summer transfer window on loan from Chelsea, but has been unable to make any impact.\nIt appeared to be an Arteta vanity project as he believed he could revive a career that had come to a dead halt at Stamford Bridge, where Sterling was marginalised by manager Enzo Maresca, despite working with him during more successful times at Manchester City.\nIf proof of the deal's failure was needed, this was it. It was a bad fit when Arsenal desperately needed a goalscorer.\nThe sight of midfielder Mikel Merino labouring as an emergency striker to no effect emphasised how Arsenal had left that key position to the fates and lost.\nArteta admitted as much as he said: \"The efficiency we had in the last 20 metres wasn't good enough. We know that.\n\"To come to Old Trafford and do what we did is superb, but you have to capitalise and we didn't. We then had to try to overturn the result after going behind and you know how difficult that is here.\"\nThis does not take into account Arsenal had 48 hours more to prepare for this game than Manchester United, who played away to Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday, and have injury problems of their own.\nArsenal, who won 7-1 at PSV in their Champions League last-16 first leg tie on Tuesday, had these factors in their favour but were still not good enough to cash in.\nRice scores equaliser but Arsenal held at Man Utd\n'We need more Brunos' - Fernandes 'steps up all the time' for Man Utd\nWhen could Liverpool seal Premier League title?\nA disappointed Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta after his side's Premier League title chase faltered again at Manchester United\nArteta, by most measures, has improved Arsenal and been successful. The only gauge that matters at a club of their stature, though, is the tangible success of trophies and he still only has their 2020 FA Cup success to show for his progress.\nThis is not to suggest the Spaniard has been a failure. Far from it.\nArteta, understandably, retains the complete faith of the Arsenal hierarchy as he has moved them in the right direction. And it is expected he will soon be working with a new sporting director in Andrea Berta, who is to succeed Edu after the Italian left the same position with Atletico Madrid in January.\nIn his first 200 matches, Arteta has 118 wins, the fifth highest tally of any manager in that amount of Premier League games.\nAnd since his appointment in succession to Unai Emery in 2019, only Pep Guardiola, his mentor at Manchester City when he was assistant manager there, has more victories and points in the Premier League.\nArteta also has eight more wins than Arsene Wenger achieved when he hit the mark of 200 top-flight matches.\nArsenal can also consider themselves live contenders for the Champions League, with a quarter-final place virtually assured after their spectacular away win at PSV.\nIt does mean, however, the pressure is increasing on Arteta to deliver a trophy that has eluded him for five years â if not this season, then certainly next.\nArsenal needed a miraculous injury-time save by keeper David Raya from Bruno Fernandes to prevent defeat at Manchester United\nArsenal must consider this season's title race a missed opportunity after running Manchester City close in the last two campaigns - only to stumble near the finishing line. City's unforeseen collapse opened the door to their rivals, but it is Arne Slot's Liverpool who have stepped through it, while the Gunners faltered once more.\nLiverpool's relentless march has seen them ease away from Arsenal, who have fallen away to such an extent that even the subdued reception from players and supporters in a corner of Old Trafford after the final whistle carried a resigned air.\nThey know the game is up.\nAsked if the title race is over in the press conference, having walked out when asked the same question by Sky Sports, the Arsenal boss said: \"I don't want to say that, but today the frustration is that we haven't won a game.\n\"We know the urgency and we are obligated to win every single match if you want to have any chance of doing that. I don't think it's the right moment to talk about that anyway.\"\nWhile it is effectively meaningless in the wider title context, it could have been even worse for Arsenal.\nGoalkeeper David Raya was culpable for Fernandes' opener, positioning himself too far to his right, allowing the Portuguese midfielder to show his expertise by planting the free-kick perfectly as the Spaniard scrambled away in vain to his left.\nThis video can not be played\nWall distance or keeper error? Why did Arsenal concede from Fernandes free-kick?\nRaya, however, made amends with two superb second-half saves from Noussair Mazraoui and Joshua Zirkzee, before a miraculous moment in the dying seconds. Having first blocked a shot from Fernandes, Raya somehow regained his position to claw the ball away from right on the line as a dramatic late United winner looked certain.\nIn between, it took a magnificent saving tackle from goalscorer Rice to rob United substitute Rasmus Hojlund as he raced into the area with only Raya to beat.\nIt will not make much difference to the destiny of the title. It simply emphasised that Arsenal's impotence at one end leaves them increasingly vulnerable at the other.\nAnd this reflects badly on Arteta and Arsenal's recruitment team, who failed to address an obvious problem up front last summer.\nAs he moves on from his managerial landmark, the urgency is growing to mark his progress in the manner that matters most.\nThat is by actually winning a trophy.\nPremier League Review with Darren Fletcher\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone"

Only seven-time champions Trabzonspor have been able to prise the title out of the city in recent years, with Bursaspor's surprise success in 2010 the only other example of the trophy spending time outside of the sprawling Turkish city.\nFenerbahce have backed Mourinho by bolstering their squad in a bid to get their hands on the title again.\nThey broke their record transfer fee to land Morocco's 2022 World Cup star Youssef En-Nesyri and the Â£16m capture from Sevilla has been repaying that spectacularly with 26 goals from 39 appearances.\nThat outlay was the big chunk of Â£33m spent on bringing in En-Nesyri, Turkey defender and boyhood Fener supporter Caglar Soyuncu - who won the FA Cup under Brendan Rodgers at Leicester City - and then Diego Carlos from Aston Villa in January.\nEven former Newcastle United winger Allan Saint-Maximin commanded a Â£6.6m loan fee from his Saudi Arabian parent club Al Alhi.\nOne would imagine that Mourinho will not have come cheaply either.\nBut despite going all-in for glory this season, their Europa League run has not gone particularly smoothly.\nThey scraped into the knockout phase by one goal in front of Braga, winning just two of their league phase matches against Union Saint-Gilloise and Slavia Prague.\nBut those victories added to draws against Twente, Manchester United, Lyon and Midtjylland were enough to get them over the line and into a play-off with Anderlecht.\nA 3-0 win at home against the Belgian club saw them get the job effectively done before a 2-2 draw in Brussels.\nWinger Allan Saint-Maximin has joined Fenerbahce on loan\nVeterans Edin Dzeko, the club captain, Dusan Tadic and Filip Kostic - on loan from Juventus -  who are 38, 36 and 32 respectively - have been lynchpins for Mourinho, with the former Manchester City striker only seven behind En-Nesyri in the goalscoring list this term despite his advancing years.\nAnother Morocco hero from that memorable run to the World Cup semi-finals in Qatar, Sofyan Amrabat, joined on loan from Fiorentina and Scotland know all about the danger of Poland's Sebastian Szymanski, who scored at Hampden during last autumn's Nations League campaign.\nOne bonus for Rangers is that former Manchester United midfielder Fred misses the first leg through suspension.\nLast season, Fenerbahce agonisingly lost out on the title by three points as a result of two draws in their final six league games.\nThey received a boost to their hopes at the weekend when Galatasaray conceded a late goal to draw with mid-table Kasimpasa while Mourinho celebrated a 3-0 win against Antalyaspor on Sunday evening.\nThey remain second but the gap has been reduced to four points.\nThe weight of expectation on Mourinho to overturn that and bring back the glory days is huge - but if he can and also add to his European haul, he could yet make himself a legend in the blue and yellow pocket of Europe's largest city.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app"

        "content": "Another eventful week at Hillsborough then?\nReports surfaced suggesting Southampton retain an interest in appointing Danny Rohl in the summer, to replace Ivan Juric.\nBoth managers were asked about the story at their press conferences. Juric said it was \"normal\" for the boss of a struggling team to be linked with the sack. He's lost all but one of his 10 Premier League matches in charge of Saints.\nMeanwhile, Rohl used a straight bat the England cricket team could have done with during the recent Champions Trophy.\nI know some people think journalists were born yesterday - but none of us expected any revelations. Sometimes you have to ask questions because fans expect you to. Nothing was ever going to be confirmed or denied. It played out as expected.\nTo be honest, the feeling that Southampton could make a fresh move for Rohl has felt like the worst-kept secret in football for a while. He was the man they wanted before and as was suggested this week, the compensation situation will be easier once Saints are relegated.\nThe German's focus will be on the final 11 games. Rohl is too professional to take his eye off the ball, particularly with a Steel City Derby on 16 March. He won't want anything to distract from the task at hand and will likely do everything to ensure that doesn't happen.\nUnfortunately for Owls fans though, they face the prospect of this coming to fruition. What happens then?\nThe club has definitely taken a step forward under Rohl's leadership, on and off the pitch. He is a top-class operator who is used to working at big clubs or with the German national team.\nIt should irk Wednesday supporters that a club like Southampton, even with a Premier League infrastructure and experience, are universally seen as a more appealing option â capable of delivering on the ambitions of a talented young boss.\nThat shouldn't just be shrugged off. There shouldn't just be a coping mechanism of a finger pointed at the German if he does move on eventually.\nIt shouldn't just be accepted that Wednesday can't compete with clubs like Southampton. They should aspire to be peers, at the very least."

We pushed out a lot last season and in the end the legs were going in maybe the last couple of weeks.\"\nClement thinks his squad has improved, especially tactically, since their 3-0 September defeat at Celtic Park in the one previous Old Firm derby this season.\n\"Last year, with less energy, we were very close and should have won the cup final,\" he suggested, referencing May's 1-0 loss in the Scottish Cup. \"The team believes it is making steps in every sense, so it is about doing that again on Sunday.\"\nCeltic have had two extra days recovery time after Tuesday's 0-0 draw away to Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League.\n\"I am not busy with that,\" Clement said while insisting it was too early to say whether in-form centre-half John Souttar would recover in time from the injury that forced him off before half-time against Spurs.\n\"I am just busy on recovering fast and focusing on ourselves. It is about recovery and then to pick the right squad to get some fresh legs in the team.\"\nClement was also not concerned about recent history favouring Celtic.\n\"Celtic are a team who are really good on the ball with a lot of quality players,\" he added.\n\"So we need to play a very mature game, well organised, but we need to play our football also and create our chances, like we have been doing in the last couple of weeks.\"\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app"

        "title": "When River Plate icon Diaz took over fourth-tier Oxford",
        "content": "Ramon Diaz spent only six months of his near 30-year managing career working in Europe - at Oxford United\nTwenty years ago a Copa Libertadores-winning legend turned up to manage mid-table fourth tier side Oxford United.\nSix months later Ramon Diaz and the rest of his seven-man entourage were blocked from even entering the ground.\nIt seems unlikely anybody will ever join the former River Plate manager, who played for Argentina, Inter Milan, Monaco and others, in winning South America's top tournament - and the League Two manager of the month award.\nBBC Sport tell the story with help from former players Steve Basham, Chris Tardif and Lucas Cominelli, BBC Oxford editor Jerome Sale, and Jean Marc Goiran, the man who brokered the deal and acted as assistant manager, translator and unofficial chief executive.\nFitness coach Pablo Fernandez, translator Guilliano Iacoppi, boss Ramon Diaz, coach Horatio Rodriguez and assistant Jean Marc Goiran (pictured from left to right) were five of the seven-strong party\nIt was December 2004.\nOxford United, the 1986 League Cup winners, were in a slump, having dropped from the second tier to the fourth since 1999 - and were sliding down League Two when owner Firoz Kassam sacked Graham Rix.\nKassam, the club's unpopular owner, invited out-of-work manager Chris Turner to watch their 1-0 defeat by Swansea - and most people thought he was the new manager, including the Oxford Mail, external and some players.\nBut instead... \"It was quite bizarre,\" said former U's striker Basham. \"Five or six guys came in, in a line. They all stood in front of us and none of them spoke a word of English, apart from one translator.\"\nGoiran said \"all the players had wide-open eyes wondering 'who are these guys?'\".\nThose guys were Diaz, head coach Horacio Rodriguez, another coach Raul Marcovich, Goiran, fitness trainer Pablo Fernandez, doctor Rafael Giulietti and translator Giuilliano Iacoppi.\nBut wait, how did it come to this? It all starts in Monaco - where Kassam and Goiran lived and Diaz also had a home having played for the club.\nKassam approached a friend of a friend, Goiran, who has worked as a football agent and consultant, to help him find a manager and the Monegasque suggested Diaz - who had left River Plate in 2002.\nAt the time it was widely reported that Diaz was not being paid to be Oxford manager - and Kassam said he had \"promised him shares in the club in return for success\".\nBut Goiran, speaking 20 years on, says Kassam's company Firoka, but not the club, instead paid Diaz and Goiran consulting fees in Monaco.\nAnd the question many have asked - why did a manager with five Argentine titles and the Copa Libertadores come to League Two Oxford?\nGoiran says it was part of a project to get to the Premier League in five years - but after a bitter ending, Diaz, who is now Corinthians manager in Brazil, never worked in England or even Europe again.\n\"When they first came in, there were grand talks about redeveloping the stadium, putting a new stand behind the goal and taking us into the Premier League,\" said goalkeeper Tardif.\nBack in 2004 there was less foreign involvement in the lower leagues in England, so it was an even big culture shock then than it is now.\nBut many of the players bought into the new training ideas, although some struggled to adapt.\n\"They brought something very new and very fresh to Oxford United at that time,\" said Basham, who played for the club between 2002 and 2007.\n\"It was way before its time. They came in with ideas and the philosophy that probably hit the English game two, three, four years later, certainly in the lower leagues.\"\nRodriguez would be hands-on - with Diaz overseeing things. To some around the club Rodriguez was seen as the traditional boss of the team with Diaz almost a director of football.\nDiaz and his coaches only spoke broken English, so had to communicate via their translator.\nBut Goiran, who was involved on the training pitch too, says Diaz was the manager and had the final say in everything.\nBasham said: \"He [Diaz] would come in amongst the team as we were laid out in our shape and he would take us through with movements. Very different, but it worked.\n\"He'd physically move you, he would then have you alongside him and he'd make the runs and you would make those runs with him.\"\nGoiran said: \"It was a very nice atmosphere. It was a great adventure. We changed the way they trained, the mentality. We taught them they are football players.\"\nThey were popular figures off the pitch too.\nBBC Oxford's Sale said: \"Ramon and his staff were imposing and impressive, but also gentle and friendly.\n\"He once asked me for $100,000 for interviews. I said the BBC wouldn't stretch that far. He said just to bring him a decent coffee next time then.\"\nRamon Diaz and his entourage were popular with the Oxford fans\nIt all started so well. They had been brought in to help the club avoid relegation but four wins and two draws in January got them dreaming of the play-offs - and Diaz was named League Two manager of the month.\nRemarkably it would take over 17 years for another Oxford manager to win an EFL award like that again - Liam Manning in September 2023.\n\"There was an immediate buzz around the ground,\" said BBC commentator Sale. \"The football went up a notch and the fun came back.\"\nDiaz and co had brought in a proper attacking style of football. Fitness and pressing were a big part of it too.\n\"We changed completely the way they play and they started to win,\" said Goiran.\n\"When a player starts to win they have pleasure, the mentality is better, they have confidence.\"\nBasham said: \"They were very much wanting to play football, which suited most of the team.\n\"I love getting the football down, love playing football, love linking play up and working to a strategy. So it was a bit different, certainly from the Ian Atkins [pragmatic lower-league manager who left Oxford in April 2004] times, which I enjoyed too.\"\nOne of Diaz's innovative strategies was leaving three quick players up the pitch while they were defending a corner in case of a counter-attacking possibility.\n\"It was more of a Pep philosophy in terms of total football even at that level,\" said Tardif, referring to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.\n\"Itâs great when it's all world-class players but in the lower leagues it's not always possible. They tried to enforce football at its purest form. We tried it. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it failed.\"\nLucas Cominelli was offered a new deal to stay with Oxford, but new manager Brian Talbot did not want any of the Argentines\nThe new management team wanted to freshen up the squad and brought in a host of trialists - some days about half of the people training were trialists.\nOut of those came a few South American signings - midfielder Lucas Cominelli, winger Juan Pablo Raponi and Uruguayan defender Mateo Corbo. Diaz's sons Emiliano and Michael - who was young and never played for the first team - also joined.\nResults were mixed.\nCominelli played 16 times, scoring a long-range effort against Grimsby, and was seen as one of the successes.\n\"Oxford were fantastic,\" said Cominelli, who had once been on the books of Newcastle without making a first-team appearance.\n\"It was really good. I had a good experience, a good memory of it from the fans, the city, the club.\"\nFull-back Corbo remains a cult hero at the club after eight yellow cards and a red card in 13 games.\nRaponi, who had played for River Plate, was too lightweight for League Two but played 10 times.\nEmiliano Diaz, who played seven times, is often mentioned in discussions about Oxford's worst ever players.\nThat was just one of many times he worked with his dad - having played under Ramon at River Plate and been his assistant manager at over 10 teams since retiring.\nCominelli added there were never issues between the England and South American players.\n\"The team-mates were really OK,\" he said. \"It was really welcome. They helped and everything. We had a good dressing room.\"\nBasham added: \"Some [were] good, some not so good. Some fitted in really well. A couple were superb, really worked hard, good on the ball, really good additions to the side.\n\"And then you had one or two that it didn't quite work out for them.\n\"Raponi was very quick, he made an impact at times, but the physical side of the game sometimes was a bit too much for him.\"\nThe falling out between Firoz Kassam (left) and Ramon Diaz (right) over the ambitions of the club proved to be the downfall of the experiment\nAfter the good run in January, though, Oxford's form took a dip, losing four of the next five games.\nAnd things were unravelling off the pitch too.\nDiaz and Kassam fell out over a difference of opinion in the ambition of the club - and over Diaz not speaking English.\nThe manager, plus some of his coaches, missed a few games for work permit or passport reasons.\nBasham said it just \"fizzled out\" as the club finished 15th - nowhere near the top or bottom.\n\"It's almost surreal looking back,\" said Tardif. \"It was difficult for them coming in our level. They weren't quite ready for having to do the basics over and over again.\n\"I really liked them as people. Do I think it was the right match? Probably not.\"\nGoiran was in discussions with Kassam about how to structure the club's marketing and finding investment.\n\"There were a lot of things to do because the club was not professional for me,\" he said. \"I spent about 12 hours per day minimum working on that and we made a lot of progress.\n\"I was more like a chief executive than other things - but I was still close on the training ground.\n\"The relationship between Ramon and Firoz was difficult. They discussed the future and financial things. Ramon didn't feel that Firoz would like to grow [the club].\"\nBasham said: \"I think they had really big plans for Oxford United. They were all pushing in the right direction.\n\"I think they all thought they were close to some sort of deal with Kassam and for whatever reason it all just ended up... yeah, there was a big fallout, which was a real shame.\"\nOnce it was obvious Diaz would probably leave the club, Goiran tried to find another manager for the project.\nDiaz resigned as manager and he and his sons flew home before the penultimate game of the season.\n\"His decision to leave was unexpected and I am disappointed,\" said Kassam at the time - who added keeping Diaz would have cost the club Â£1m.\nThe Oxford Mail even reported that Rodriguez was set to become the new manager., external\nBut suddenly the entire experiment was over. Before the final game of the season, at home to Chester, Kassam got rid of Diaz's entire backroom staff and appointed Brian Talbot.\nGoiran was offered the chance to stay but said \"I brought these people in and if they're going out I have to go with them\".\n\"Everything was so OK except the relationship between Firoz and Ramon. We had a lot of good plans for the future, a lot of ideas regarding investors to change the club and grow. But it was a bad ending,\" Goiran said.\nAnd it got very messy as Diaz and his coaches bought tickets to watch the final game of the season against Chester and to say thank you to the Oxford supporters.\nBut Kassam ordered his stewards to refuse them entry and an argument broke out 10 minutes into the game - with fans leaving their seats to ask they be let in.\n\"We had to take the car and left everything there. It was not a good ending,\" said Goiran.\n\"I was very sad to leave the club. It was a fantastic time. I did it with my heart plus everything. The feeling I have with the fans was 'wow'.\n\"It's my club forever - Iâm always looking at their results. It's a love story between me and Oxford.\"\nThat was the end of all the South American players too.\nCominelli said: \"The club had offered me a new contract. I wanted to stay but the new coach who came [Talbot], he decided all the foreign players [should be] gone.\"\nKassam and Diaz, through his current club Corinthians, did not respond to requests to speak to the BBC for this feature.\nThe following season Talbot was sacked, Kassam sold the club and Oxford were relegated to the Conference."

        "content": "This video can not be played\nWe wanted one thing, to reach the final - Slot\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was delighted to book his first place in an English final - but warned \"it's only special if you can win things\".\nThe Reds demolished Tottenham 4-0 in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg to turn around a 1-0 first-leg deficit.\nLiverpool, who won the cup last season under Jurgen Klopp, will face Newcastle in the Wembley final on Sunday, 16 March.\nThis is 46-year-old Dutchman Slot's first season in English football, having moved from Feyenoord in the summer, and the first time he will have been to Wembley.\nCiting the 1992 European Cup final, where Barcelona beat Sampdoria 1-0 at Wembley, he told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We all know as Dutch people how important Wembley was for Ronald Koeman and Barcelona and Johan Cruyff.\n\"It is special to go there as I know how iconic that stadium is.\"\nBut he added: \"It's only special if you can win things. We know how difficult that's going to be as Newcastle are an impressive team.\"\nSlot won the Dutch Cup with Feyenoord last season, beating NEC 1-0 in the final.\n\"It's always nice to play a final,\" he said.\n\"We come in every day, we try to improve the team. The players try so hard to improve themselves, but in the end it's about reaching finals and winning things.\"\nAnd he added that it was probably his best night as Liverpool manager so far - in an impressive campaign to date in which he has won 29 of his 37 games in charge and only lost three.\n\"I think we had some big nights here already but to reach a final should also be special, and that is what it is,\" he said.\n\"So in that perspective it has been the most special evening.\"\nJose Mourinho won the Carling Cup (right) in his first season as Chelsea boss and months later added the Premier League (centre)\nWith a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League and into the last 16 of the Champions League, Slot will be hoping success in the EFL Cup is just the start for his side this season.\nHe will be following several other managers in trying to use the competition as a springboard for further glory.\nOf the 11 bosses to have won the Premier League title, four lifted the League Cup, as the competition was formerly known, before doing so - Alex Ferguson, Manuel Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola.\nFor Mourinho and Guardiola in particular, it was not only their first trophy in the country but the beginning of a memorable period at the top of the English game.\nOn their 2005 League Cup win, Mourinho's Chelsea captain John Terry said: \"It set us on our way. It gave us a taste of what we wanted - more.\n\"A lot of people write this competition off but for me it is huge and we look back on that 2004-05 season... it had a huge impact on our confidence and momentum.\"\nIn Mourinho's own words: \"If there is any secret, it's to take it seriously.\"\nJust a few months after winning the League Cup for the first time, Mourinho - like Pellegrini and Guardiola at Manchester City - went on to win the league.\nLiverpool are favourites to win the Premier League, the Champions League and the EFL Cup - and not far off to win the FA Cup.\nThe Reds' season has been remarkable, given a dip was thought to be inevitable when the legendary Klopp left.\nThe only time Klopp won multiple major trophies in a season was in 2021-22, when they won the FA Cup and EFL Cup.\n\"This could be a really, really special season for Liverpool,\" said ex-Reds defender Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports.\n\"They've been in this situation at this stage of the season, with four trophies still available, I think twice in the past three or four years under Jurgen Klopp and they came away with two Carabao Cups and one FA Cup. They didn't get the big ones.\n\"The most important thing is to win the big trophies, the Premier League and Champions League.\"\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp added: \"They're in a fantastic position, everything is looking so good for them.\n\"Can they capitalise on it and do something unprecedented by winning four trophies? I think you're never going to get a better chance.\n\"Liverpool right now are arguably the best team in the world. It's almost beyond his wildest dreams.\n\"When he came here, following someone like Jurgen Klopp, he would've just been hoping it goes well. For him to do what he's done is absolutely phenomenal. He's been magnificent.\"\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone"

        "content": "This video can not be played\nNisbet scores with a superb improvised finish\nGiven he was on the bench for his country as recently as last October, it might seem strange to consider Kevin Nisbet as Scotland's forgotten man.\nHowever, such was the anonymity of his spell at Millwall that, for many, the striker fell completely off the international radar.\nFive goals in his last six games for Aberdeen, including a birthday strike on Saturday against Queen's Park in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals have returned him to the conversation.\nSo when Steve Clarke announces his squad for the Nations League play-off matches against Greece - live on BBC Scotland - later this month, could 28-year-old Nisbet be a key figure for his country?\nAberdeen reach Scottish Cup semis by beating Queen's Park\nMore Aberdeen reaction, analysis & your views\nWhen the former Hibs striker arrived on loan at Pittodrie at the start of this season, looking to find the form that tempted Millwall to spend a reported Â£2m on him, it looked like a solid investment.\nNisbet scored a late winner against Ross County, before netting against Dundee two games later. It seemed the replacement for Bojan Miovski had been found.\nHowever, there were only another five starts before the new year and just a single goal in that time. He might have hit the ground running, but that start soon stalled.\nBut Nisbet has been at the forefront of Aberdeen turning their fortunes around again, scoring five goals in his last six and looking more dangerous in the box.\nHis latest goal was one of his best in this hot run, putting Aberdeen ahead with an audacious backheel flick direct from a corner.\n\"The real Kevin Nisbet has turned up,\" said former Pittodrie captain and manager Willie Miller on Sportsound. \"That is just magnificent.\n\"He's on the run, he's beyond the near post and guides it into the top corner. That is a wonderful, wonderful goal.\"\nFellow BBC pundit Stephen McGinn agreed: \"That is Nisbet at his confident best. A natural goalscorer, feeling good about his game, feeling as fit as he ever has done at Aberdeen.\"\nWith Lyndon Dykes set to miss out on the play-off games through injury, there is a place up for grabs in Clarke's squad.\nIf he has to choose between Lawrence Shankland and Nisbet, the choice seems clear.\nShankland might be in the squad, but his form has nosedived this season and he remains on just four goals this campaign - with only one since Christmas.\nOf course, there is also Che Adams who has scored seven in Serie A this year and found fitness, starting plenty of late.\nBut Nisbet's recent form is making a compelling case.\n\"I saw in an interview recently he said he felt very fit,\" McGinn said. \"That's a big part of his game.\n\"He's a clever player, a natural goalscorer and, when he's feeling good about himself, he's capable of getting back into the Scotland squad.\"\nIt would mark a superb comeback for the forward, but he insisted that it's not on the forefront of his mind.\n\"I'm not even thinking about that,\" he told BBC Scotland when asked about an international recall. Aye right, Kevin...\nWhat did you make of Nisbet's performance? Is he getting back to his best?\nLet us know here, external"

        "title": "Welshman Ramsay on why he chose coaching in MLS over Championship",
        "content": "Eric Ramsay guided Minnesota United to sixth spot in MLS Western Conference in 2024\nEric Ramsay is convinced his decision to accept a head coaching role in Major League Soccer rather than the Championship will benefit his overall development.\nThe 33-year-old Welshman starts his first full season at Minnesota United against LAFC on Saturday, having joined the club in March last year before guiding them into the play-offs, where they were beaten in the Western Conference semi-finals by eventual winners LA Galaxy.\nProviding Ramsay lasts the first month of the new campaign, he will become the 17th Major League Soccer boss â out of a possible 29 â to have been in charge for more than a year.\nBy contrast, of the 18 Championship managers who started last season at clubs who are still in the second tier, only two, Leeds and Middlesbrough, still have the same man in charge.\nThe bleak statistics are why Ramsay chose the USA to step up following extended spells as a youth coach at Chelsea before joining the first-team set-up at Manchester United.\n\"I am self-aware enough to know I am by no means the finished article as a head coach,\" Ramsay told BBC Sport.\n\"I wanted an experience that was going to give me the best chance to develop, the opportunity to make some mistakes and manage something that feels big.\n\"It feels like there is scrutiny on MLS. There is media to deal with. There is pressure you have to deal with exist, albeit not to the same extent as England.\n\"The Championship would have been equally as testing, if not more so, but with that constant nagging doubt, looking objectively, that there is a much shorter life-cycle for guys who go into that league. All round this was a relatively sensible decision.\"\nRamsay is, by some distance, the youngest coach in MLS.\nHe is following a trend of clubs trusting youthful bosses, including 31-year-old Fabian Hurzeler at Brighton and 32-year-old Will Still, who is in charge at Ligue 1 side Lens.\nRamsay followed the coaching path after graduating from Loughborough University with a sports science and management degree.\nHe worked at Swansea and Shrewsbury before joining Chelsea in 2019 and then moving on to Manchester United, initially as player development coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, in 2021.\n\"I had reached a logical point to pursue an opportunity like this,\" said Ramsay.\n\" I had two-and-a-half years at Chelsea, been with the Welsh national team and had two-and-a-half years at Man Utd â and two-and-a-half years there can feel like five or six.\"\nWhat to look out for in MLS this season\nThe secondary aspect around Ramsay's move is a feeling that experience gained in MLS will open doors later in his coaching career that he feels might have stayed closed had he remained in England.\n\"The coaching world has not been open for British coaches,\" he said. \"I feel like if you lost your first or second job as a coach in the Championship, you wouldn't then have a case to go and look across the continent to where your next job might be. It is not a well-trodden path.\n\"Sometimes the coaches who arrive at the top level in England are those who have been across various countries. Their status is safer because there are more jobs available. It feels a little bit more open. I had that in mind when I went to MLS.\n\"It is a really interesting one and riles up lots of debate. I genuinely feel the level of coaching in England is in a really impressive place.\n\"Maybe coming back from MLS, there are a few more trodden paths to other places than there are from the Championship.\"\nAlthough he has moved 4,000 miles away, he still keeps a close eye on events at Old Trafford.\nErik ten Hag has been sacked since he left but the club's fortunes are yet to improve as, after a below-par eighth-place finish last season, they have fallen further down the table.\n\"The Manchester United situation is incredibly complex,\" Ramsay said.\n\"I can only speak from the experience I had across three or four coaches, if you include Michael Carrick. You do have a lot of very good people doing their absolute best to get the club back on track amid what is an ever more competitive Premier League.\n\"You are not talking just the traditional top four, you are talking between eight or 10 teams who can make an incredible mark on the top three or four.\n\"It has become far more difficult than it ever was for Manchester United and that's without taking into account everything they have gone through when it comes to change and transition in leadership.\n\"I do genuinely feel there will be an incredible amount of good work going on behind the scenes. It is just whether it can bear fruit in comparison to all the good work and huge amounts of money other clubs are spending.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

        "content": "Panenka - the penalty that killed a career and started a feud\nIn the end, the Germans' eagerness to go on holiday changed history.\nTheir Euro 1976 final against Czechoslovakia was never meant to go to penalties.\nWest Germany - defending European champions, reigning World Cup winners - were heavy favourites.\nEven if Czechoslovakia held out through extra time, the initial plan had been for a replay two days later. Welsh referee Clive Thomas had been told to delay his return home from host nation Yugoslavia to cover the eventuality.\nA few hours before the match though, the plan changed.\n\"It was a request from the German Football Association,\" remembers Antonin Panenka.\n\"They said that their players had already booked some holidays, blah, blah, blah, and asked if penalties could be taken straight away instead of a replay.\"\nCzechoslovakia figured, as underdogs, they were more likely to prevail in a shoot-out than a second match, so they agreed.\nPanenka, an elegant, passing playmaker, mentally checked his plan once more.\nAll was in order. No alteration necessary, no doubt admitted.\nA ploy two years in the making that would make him famous and infamous, a hero and an enemy - whether it succeeded or not - was ready.\nAntonin Panenka played 59 times for Czechoslovakia, scoring 17 goals, and was named as part of Uefa's Team of the Tournament at Euro 1976\nBack home, Panenka had been involved in another, almost daily, penalty contest.\nAfter training at his Prague club side Bohemians, Panenka and goalkeeper Zdenek Hruska would stay behind to practise spot-kicks.\nIt was a very personal duel. Panenka would have five penalties - he would have to score all five, Hruska would have to save just one. Whoever lost would buy their post-training beer or chocolate.\n\"I was constantly paying him,\" says Panenka.\n\"So in the evenings I would think up ways to beat him - that's when I realised that as I ran up the goalkeeper would wait for the last second and then gamble, diving to the left or the right.\n\"I thought: 'What if I send the ball almost directly into the centre of the goal?'\"\nPanenka tried it. He found that introducing another possible penalty and some hesitation to Hruska's mind meant he was winning more, spending less and still getting his post-training treat.\nIt could have stopped there and remained a piece of unseen showboating. But Panenka realised his new technique was more than that. He had unearthed a legitimate 12-yard tactic.\nOver the next couple of years, he tested it on larger and larger stages. First, in training, then in friendlies and finally, the month before Euro 1976, against local rivals Dukla Prague in a competitive fixture.\nEach time it worked and his conviction grew.\n\"I made no secret of it,\" Panenka says.\n\"Here [in Czechoslovakia] people were well aware of it.\n\"But in western countries, in top football countries nobody was interested in Czechoslovak football at all.\n\"Maybe they were kept up with some results, but they didn't watch our games.\"\nSo, there was no laminated cheat sheet or whispered instructions from a backroom analyst for Sepp Maier.\nAs the West German goalkeeper crouched on his goalline and fixed his eyes on Panenka, he had only his own instincts to go on.\nMaier's team-mate Uli Hoeness had blazed the previous spot-kick over the bar. It was the first miss of the shoot-out, after extra time finished with the teams still locked together at 2-2.\nInstantly the stakes became sudden death and sky high. If Panenka scored, West Germany were beaten.\nPanenka's run-up was long and fast. He seemed intent, like Hoeness, on thumping his instep through the back of the ball.\nInstead, with the most important kick of his life, he fell back on his trusted trick. A deft tickle sent the ball floating down the centre of the goal. Panenka's arm was aloft in celebration before it hit the net. Maier, flummoxed and failing, scrambled back to his feet, but only in time to shoot a rueful look at Panenka wheeling away in celebration.\nPanenka's clipped penalty secured a 5-3 shoot-out win after a 2-2 draw following extra time\n\"None of us could believe we were European champions,\" said Panenka. \"It was like Alice in Wonderland.\"\nIt was just as surreal back in Prague. Their European Championship win came eight years after the Prague Spring - when a Soviet-led herd of tanks had rolled across the border and crushed attempts to loosen the country's communist system.\nSince then, large public gatherings had been rare, permitted only for orchestrated welcomes of foreign dignitaries. When the team arrived with Czechoslovakia though, there was no holding back the emotion or the numbers.\n\"Nobody expected that so many people would come to give us such a warm welcome,\" Panenka remembers.\n\"When some head of state came, the roads used to be lined with young people holding parade wands.\n\"But it was all sort of forced. This time though they all came spontaneously to greet us and show their appreciation. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was one of the best moments of my football career.\"\nPanenka's decisive, distinctive penalty made him centre of attention. Not just for the crowd, but for the authorities as well.\nCzechoslovakians had been subjected to a process dubbed 'normalisation' since their attempt to diverge from the Soviet model. The remoulding or removing of dissident elements had gone far beyond politics.\nJust three months before Euro 1976, Czechoslovakia's secret police had arrested a psychedelic rock band and other underground musicians, fearful that long hair and counter-cultural lyrics alone could fuel revolution.\nIt is estimated that more than 4,500 tanks, led by the Soviet Union and support by Eastern Bloc nations Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary, entered Czechoslovakia in 1968\nPanenka's penalty - hit with a disregard for convention and casual panache - was definitely not \"normal\".\nTo repeat his trick on a stage of such scale carried significant personal, as well as sporting, risk.\n\"I would never have thought that politics and sport or politics and football could be linked like this, but it's true that there were some looking at it in this way,\" says Panenka.\n\"When it was discussed in political circles, they could take it as my contempt for the political system.\n\"If I hadn't converted the penalty, it probably would have had some consequences for me, some sanction or another problem.\"\nThat Panenka found the net spared him uncomfortable questions and a possible new career in a factory or mine.\nBut by scoring he made another enemy.\nDefeat was an unusual sensation for Maier, part of a Bayern side that had won its third straight European Cup the previous month. Humiliation was unheard of.\nThe Scotsman's report from Belgrade described how Panenka's one kick blew apart two preconceptions: Czechoslovakia's faceless, collective style and West Germany, and Maier's, inevitable competence, control and victory.\n\"Czechoslovakia's old, hard discipline is still evident,\" wrote Ian Wood.\n\"But the cult of the personality has gained more than a fragile toe-hold and nowhere was the new zest more perfectly illustrated than when Panenka gave the Czechs the championship by grounding the hapless Sepp Maier with a dummy of supreme impudence.\"\nElsewhere there were harsher descriptions than \"hapless\".\n\"Some foreign journalists, especially the ones from the West, insisted that I made fun of Maier, that I made him a clown and things like that,\" says Panenka.\n\"It was not true. For me, it was just the easiest way to score a goal. But Maier believed what those journalists wrote about me having ridiculed him.\n\"Whenever he heard the name 'Panenka', it was terribly unpleasant for him and he would react very irritably.\n\"He didn't speak to me for the next 35 years.\"\nPanenka and Maier have been reunited at several charity and commemorative events since the Euro 1976 final\nBut as the decades passed, there has been a thaw.\nSince the original, the 'Panenka' has been repeated and proven as a bona-fide - if high-risk - tactic by some of the biggest names on the most momentous occasions.\nZinedine Zidane scored one in the 2006 World Cup final against Italy. Memorably for England fans, Andrea Pirlo clipped one past Joe Hart in a Euro 2012 shoot-out. Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic have all pulled it off.\nMaier is no longer a lonely fall guy. Plenty of goalkeepers have been similarly beaten. The sting of 1976 has been drawn, the stigma is gone. Mostly.\nMaier declined a request to be interviewed for this article.\n\"I think that our relationship has been perfectly normal lately,\" says Panenka.\n\"The last time I met him was four or five years ago. There was some press conference arranged by the German side here in Prague, and I could see that he wasn't annoyed or angry with me. We had a beer and played golf together.\n\"He could even smile about the penalty kick. When he first saw me on that most recent trip, he wagged his finger at me and gestured the trajectory of a chipped ball with his hand.\"\nEven Panenka's own relationship with his 1976 penalty is complex.\nHis fizzing set-pieces, his dead-eyed shooting, his scalpel-sharp passing goes uncredited, buried under the fame of his own creation.\n\"I am a bit down the middle about it,\" he says fittingly and finally about the 1976 penalty.\n\"On the one hand I am proud that the penalty was invented, that it is so famous and that it is repeated by the best players. But it's true that whenever the name Panenka is mentioned, everybody just thinks about 'the Panenka penalty'.\n\"So on the one hand I am proud, but on the other hand I am a bit unhappy that the penalty erased everything I wanted to give the viewers - a lot of passes, goals, chances I created.\n\"In a sense, the penalty killed my career.\"\nIf he had that moment again, staring down Maier, the European Championship on the line, would he dare to do the same again? Or would he play it straight with a shot that wouldn't define him forever for so many?\nPanenka's answer is emphatic.\n\"Of course, I would do the same! Sure! I can't do anything else.\"\nMadrid, Mbappe and a mission of a lifetime\n'I was lost' - Dancing with fans, hiding the pain"

        "title": "St Mirren look to add to unforgettable season live on BBC",
        "content": "Stephen Robinson had to deal with three exits following court cases\nScottish Cup: St Mirren v Heart of Midlothian\nVenue: SMISA Stadium, Paisley Date: Monday, 10 February Kick-off: 19:45 GMT.\nCoverage: Watch on BBC Scotland, iPlayer & BBC Sport website, listen on BBC Sounds\nIt might turn out to be another memorable season for St Mirren. A third successive top-six Premiership finish remains a possibility and the Buddies are still in the Scottish Cup.\nOn Monday they host Heart of Midlothian live on the BBC with the final place in the cup quarter-finals up for grabs, but whatever happens in the game, it's a season manager Stephen Robinson is unlikely to forget.\nWatch: Scottish Cup last-16 highlights\nQueen's Park & Davidson stand tall amid Ibrox bedlam\nRangers players 'lose everything' in cup humiliation\nIt started promisingly with their first European campaign since 1987 and trips to Iceland and Norway.\nBy autumn, though, that campaign was behind them and three summer signings, defenders Shaun Rooney and Jaden Brown as well as striker Kevin van Veen, had left the club amid three unrelated court cases.\nHow did Robinson deal with that?\n''It's not something they teach you on the Uefa pro-licence course,\" he said. \"It's certainly been the most testing season off the pitch.\n\"All the boys I bring in, I have a bond with them. You try and get to know them as much as you possibly can, so it's not nice to see people losing their jobs.\n''I think the Uefa courses give you the bare minimum. I feel that managers should be contributing given the reality of problems they encounter and how they deal with them, whether it's successful or not, and how you'd do things differently.\n''But, with a little bit more experience, you do learn to deal with it, you learn to just compartmentalise it a little bit, and deal with what you can in front of you.\n''You have to be there to try and support people at the same time, so really, really difficult in terms of dealing with people but also the effect it has on the rest of the squad, and trying to lift them again, and I think the players have been super.''\nThe European campaign, joyous but short-lived, put its strains on players and staff alike.\n''It was always a challenge for a club of our size to reach Europe, to compete in Europe, to build a squad for Europe so quickly,\" Robinson explained.\n\"The infrastructure at the football club was not set up to be in Europe, so a lot of pressure on the staff at the football club, both football and non-football staff.\n''So to be two points off where we were last season at this stage in the league is an absolute testament to the character of the squad and the football club as a whole.\n\"You can't expect St Mirren continually be a top-six side with the resources and the size of other football clubs, but you have to make the cut more often than in the past.''\nHearts beat St Mirren 4-0 in their latest meeting at Tynecastle in October\nThe Buddies are just outside the top half of the table, level on points with one of those bigger clubs, Hearts - the sides they meet in the fifth round of the cup in Paisley on Monday.\n''All you ask for in a cup game is to get a home tie,\" Robinson said. \"We've actually been better on the road this season, but we've got a home tie.\n\"It'll be a full house. It's something we want to embrace. We know that Hearts have spent a lot of money to put a really, really good squad together.\n''They've got a very good manager in Neil Critchley and he's starting to put his stamp on Hearts now.\"\nRobinson believes Hearts' new recruitment model is already bearing fruit with the involvement of Brighton & Hove Albion owner Tony Bloom's and his data analytics company, a model the Northern Irishman envies.\n''We'd love Tony to come in and stick 10 million pounds into the club - and that would be fantastic,\" he said.\n\"So, if Tony's reading this, St Mirren would be happy to take your analytics for a few years anyway!\n''We can't afford that. We've got one scout in the whole world, Martin Foyle, who does an amazing job, an amazing job with his contacts and the amount of people that he brings in for us.\n\"We get so much value for money from the players that Martin brings in, so I can't praise him enough.''\nAlthough the clubs are level in the league table, and even on the head to head count this season with a win apiece at home expects, the visitors will be regarded as favourites to reach the quarter-finals.\n''They should be expected to win,\" Robinson added. \"And they'll come out and play and play in an open style. They have got a little bit more direct in recent games.\n''What we've struggled with this season is playing teams that have played a little bit deeper. Away from home, you're able to play on the counter-attack, which suits the personnel that we have.\n\"We have to be more creative. But Hearts will come and play. So that leaves gaps, it leaves spaces and, hopefully, will make for a good cup game.''\nVisit our St Mirren page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet St Mirren news notifications in the BBC Sport app"

I'm struggling myself to get answers,\" McLean told BBC Radio Norfolk after the game.\n\"We can't turn up and play football for 45 minutes every week. It's not enough.\"\nDefeat was the fourth time Norwich have lost from a winning position this season and takes the number of points dropped after taking the lead to a Championship-high 30.\nMcLean says that is something \"we have to fix\" but added, \"we still don't have the answers, or are able to find the answers, during games\".\nHe continued: \"It's actually a shambles. We need to do so much more. When teams get a goal, they know we're vulnerable.\n\"That's the worst probably this season [the performance] - that was evident at the final whistle with the crowd.\"\nMcLean said he thought the issue might be a mixture of both their tactical and mental approach during matches.\n\"A bit of everything,\" the 33-year-old Scot said. \"I'd love to be able to say exactly what it was. We've got experience of being in these positions a lot this season and it still continues to happen. It's such a frustration.\n\"We're a nice team. When it clicks, it's really good. When things go against us, it's shocking. We need to deal with tough situations better and stand up to the challenges teams throw at us.\n\"We're not wresting control back. We should know what we're doing. We should be more resilient, more committed to winning second balls. At times, we're the best footballers in the league and it baffles me.\n\"We're being told to adapt during games but we're not doing it at the right times.  As soon as teams come after us, and we lose the ball, we crumble. One mistake always leads to another and then another.\n\"There seems to be an anxiety across us when we make a mistake - teams see that vulnerability in us and we don't deal with it.\"\nLatest Norwich City news and analysis\nListen to BBC Radio Norfolk's The Scrimmage podcast"

        "title": "Europe's best title race? The 'chaos' of 2. Bundesliga",
        "content": "Cologne are top of the German second division after winning their past three league games\n\"It's chaos,\" says German football journalist Mark Lovell, when asked to describe the 2. Bundesliga title race this season - and he is right.\nWith 13 games remaining in this campaign, the battle for the two automatic promotion places - plus the single play-off spot against the 16th-placed Bundesliga side - in the German second tier is the most engrossing race in European football this season.\nJust six points separate the top six after 21 matches, with 10 points between the top 10 in the 18-team league. Seven sides have led the division and more than a quarter of games have ended in draws.\nThe clubs involved come from every walk of German football life too.\nCurrent leaders Cologne are Bundesliga regulars who suffered relegation last season, and have defied a two-window transfer ban which ended in January to achieve their lofty rank.\nThe top 10 of the 2. Bundesliga table after 21 games\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nCologne sit two points ahead of former European Cup winners Hamburg, spending their seventh-straight season in 2. Bundesliga having previously never been relegated from the top flight, and four-time national champions Kaiserslautern.\nFor Kaiserslautern, this season is the latest step in a remarkable recent history which saw them fall into the third tier in 2018 for four years amid financial hardship, before a recent recovery and even reaching the German Cup final last season.\n\"They just barely scraped by one year and right now they're on the rebound,\" George Brown, founder of the American Kaiserslautern Fan Club, tells BBC Sport.\n\"Kaiserslautern has a population of just under 100,000. Towns of this size in Germany normally have a stadium of about 12,000 [but] they have a stadium of almost 50,000. They believe that their place is up at the top level in the Bundesliga.\"\nA further three points back are Magdeburg, the only side from the old East Germany to win a European trophy â the 1974 Cup Winners' Cup â but who have never played in the Bundesliga.\nMost remarkably of all, all nine of their league wins this season have come in away games, their 10 home matches delivering seven draws and three defeats.\nThere are other contenders too. Fortuna Dusseldorf, who missed out on promotion last season after throwing away a three-goal lead in the play-off, have led the league for longer than any other side and sit fifth. Just below are recognisable names like Hannover and Nuremberg, not forgetting SV Elversberg who are spending just their second season at this level â yet led the division as late as matchday 16.\nMagdeburg are in promotion contention after winning nine of their 11 away league games this season\nAnd for the final ingredient, add an average attendance of more than 30,000 fans per game. This is boosted by huge crowds at former Champions League sides Hertha Berlin and Schalke, though they are 13th and 14th respectively, and more concerned about relegation.\nSo yes, it's chaos â but why is it so close?\nAccording to Lovell, a key factor is money â but unlike its English counterpart it is  a lack thereof, rather than an imbalanced abundance.\n\"It's not distorted like the Championship is with these parachute payments coming down, Premier League clubs being rewarded for failure with these huge lumps of cash,\" he says.\n\"In German football, they do have a better TV deal then they've had historically but it is nothing like the Championship. It is quite a struggle to get back immediately to the top flight.\n\"Look at Hamburg. Former European champions, Kevin Keegan [as a former player], they were the reason I got interested in German football, they were historically one of the biggest clubs in Germany and very proud of their record of never being relegated from the top flight.\n\"They were termed the dinosaur because they were never going to get relegated but that fate happened and they haven't been able to get back.\"\nRobert Stokowy, a former Cologne native who is now part of the FC Cologne Supporters USA group, says this title race is the result of smaller, well-run clubs colliding with monoliths experiencing tougher times.\n\"There's pressure from below, and there's pressure from the first division,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"Cologne are an elevator team. Last season we just got beaten badly, and if you look at the Bundesliga right now you have such a discrepancy between how much money teams have, and there's just no way that that is a healthy and interesting competition.\n\"What we have [in 2.Bundesliga] is a couple more investors, so some of the clubs from the third division get picked up and all of a sudden they get elevated â look at the rise of Heidenheim and Union Berlin.\n\"I think the second division is the sweet spot because there is some TV revenue, there's an interesting mix of clubs from the first division who had glory days back then, and you have the ones who come up from the lower leagues.\n\"It is an example of what you can do if you run your club well.\"\nHamburg spent 55 straight seasons in the Bundesliga before their current seven-year stint in the second division\nThat excitement has drawn in the spectators and Marco Fuchs and Maike Baensch, chair and deputy of The Supporters Karlsruhe, say membership has tripled.\nKarlsruhe however are one of the victims of such a fickle league as a run of four winless games has sent them tumbling from second to 10th.\n\"It's a difficult situation,\" says Baensch. \"You want people to be engaged in the league, enjoying every game but at the same time it's frustrating and demoralising to think that you're right up there and then all of a sudden you're back in mid table.\"\nNo fan or club, Brown says, can be confident in predicting what the season will hold in the final 13 matches.\n\"All the conversations that I've seen are incredibly cautious,\" he says. \"One of the things that everybody always says is you don't ever talk about a promotion until you get 40 points. The theory is no team has ever been relegated that had 40 points or more.\n\"But it certainly has made every single match incredible. It doesn't matter if you're the home or away team, it doesn't matter if you're playing the last place team or the first. You have no idea what you're going to get and that just builds excitement and drives people to the stadium.\n\"I wouldn't advise people to gamble on this league because you just never know what's going to happen,\" adds Lovell. \"Top can beat bottom, and just because you were in the Bundesliga last season doesn't guarantee anything.\""

        "title": "Who has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?",
        "content": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nDean Henderson (Crystal Palace): It was a very scrappy game against Ipswich - he faced 15 shots, with eight of them on target, and did well to keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 win. He is a contender for an England starting position. I know that might be a bit wild to say, but he has been excellent for Palace during their upturn in form.\nOla Aina (Nottingham Forest): Nottingham Forest were superb in their 1-0 victory against Manchester City - and both Aina and Murillo have been great all season. They shut down a City team that really needed to win.\nTyrone Mings (Aston Villa): It was just great to see him back playing against Brentford and enjoying his football. He has had a lot of injury mishaps but has never quit and never shirked a challenge. He did well as Villa won 1-0 to stay in the hunt for top four.\nMurillo (Nottingham Forest): He has been really good all year. You can see why they put so much emphasis on tying him down to a long-term contract.\nMilos Kerkez (Bournemouth): For me he is one of the best left-backs in world football already. He is exceptional with the ball and without it, runs all day and has loads of room to grow. It is not surprising that Liverpool have been linked to him.\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): People gave him stick for celebrating his equaliser against Manchester United. When he doesn't score people say he doesn't score enough - but when he does he gets stick for celebrating! He is growing into a really talented 'number eight'. Especially as Arsenal don't have a number nine, he runs into great pockets and got beyond the attackers for his goal.\nBruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): Scored the only goal against West Ham in a must-win match for his team in the Champions League race. It can be hard for players with a massive game like the Carabao Cup final coming up on Sunday - no player wants to get injured before that. But he was one of the few that didn't shirk a tackle, and still played this game at full intensity.\nBruno Fernandes (Man Utd): I have been critical of Fernandes over the years. He is the type of person that got away with it when the team were poor under Erik ten Hag. Since the new manager has come in, he has shown a completely new level of character. If Manchester United want to get to where they aspire to be, then they need this guy. They cannot get rid of him. It was also unbelievable technique for the free-kick.\nMohamed Salah (Liverpool): He wasn't great on the day against Southampton, but despite not being at his best he still scored two goals to help extend Liverpool's lead at the top of the league.\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): Scored a good goal in Villa's win over Brentford. He celebrated against his old team, which he should do - a good weekend for him!\nIsmaila Sarr (Crystal Palace): Showed a moment of class to go through and score the winner against Ipswich. Let's be honest, this week was an awful one for teams - there was no standout match. A lot of scrappy performances and it looked like the players need an international break.\nEddie Howe (Newcastle): It is another massive week for Newcastle - Howe could have easily chosen a different team against West Ham and rested everybody so they were ready for the cup final.\nInstead he went for it and made sure he got the job done - despite being without Anthony Gordon and Lewis Hall - and they are now level on points with fifth-placed Man City.\nHe deserves credit for instilling that 'win every game' mentality.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

We believe as a club, as players â there's a lot of teams that when they get promoted they ride the wave and they carry on into the next league. Winning is an infectious thing, if you win you keep winning.\"\n'Drama unlike any movie' - Time for more promotion and relegation?\nA penalty, a smirk and an armband that went viral\nBromley beat Solihull Moors in the National League promotion final at Wembley in May\nBromley began the season with wins in their first ever EFL match - away to Harrogate Town - and in the first ever EFL game at Hayes Lane, against London rivals AFC Wimbledon.\nThe failed to win any of their next nine League Two matches to leave them two points above the relegation zone.\nBut 12 matches without defeat followed as they climbed into the top half of the table at the start of 2025.\nA win at Tranmere Rovers on Saturday, with other results also going their way could move Bromley within one point of the play-offs with 10 games of the season remaining.\n\"We're punching above our weight, we're keeping clean sheets and we're probably riding our luck a bit. But that all makes for an exciting season,\" Webster said.\nBromley striker Michael Cheek is League Two's joint top scorer with 16 goals\nKey to Bromley's success has been the form of all-time top scorer Michael Cheek, who leads the way in the league scoring charts alongside Alassana Jatta of Notts County and Wimbledon's Matty Stevens, with 16 goals.\nWebster, who spent five years playing for Millwall, said he was surprised Cheek had never had the opportunity to play higher up in the football pyramid.\n\"He really is an absolute machine in front of goal and I think if you have that knack as a striker, you never lose it no matter what standard or level you play at,\" he said.\n\"He finds the spaces, he's fantastic in the air, good with either foot and it's surprising that it's taken for Bromley to get in the league for him to get his chance there.\n\"Now he's proven he can do it at the Football League standard and he's doing it with a smile on his face.\"\nWebster's career has spanned more than 20 years since its beginnings in York City.\nThe centre-back has represented the likes of Yeovil Town, Carlisle United and Millwall, and has a 100% winning record at Wembley with four victories in four finals.\nHe will turn 38 at the end of March, but has no intentions of retiring and would love to take the club to the third tier.\n\"Two years ago I never thought I still would be playing, I still am and enjoying it. A number of people keep doubting, keep trying to retire me possibly but I keep proving them wrong and keep playing so long may that continue,\" Webster added.\n\"I think at the end of your career you look at the history you've made.

        "content": "This video can not be played\nWatch: Man Utd unveil images of new stadium\nManchester United have announced plans to build the biggest stadium in the UK - an \"iconic\" new Â£2bn 100,000-seater ground close to Old Trafford.\nOnce construction is complete, the club's existing home is likely to be demolished.\nCo-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted to build the \"world's greatest football stadium\", which the club hopes could be finished in five years.\nUnited's announcement comes after an extensive consultation process around whether to develop the existing stadium or build a new one.\nOld Trafford has been Manchester United's home since 1910.\nThe club would continue to play at Old Trafford until the new stadium was ready.\nSenior club sources have previously said it would not be cost effective to shrink it for use as a home for United's women's and youth teams.\nArchitects at Foster and Partners, who will design the project, said the new stadium would feature an umbrella design and a new public plaza that is \"twice the size of Trafalgar Square\".\nThe design will feature three masts described as \"the trident\", which the architects say will be 200 metres high and visible from 25 miles away.\nManchester United, currently Â£1bn in debt, are yet to say how they plan to pay for the stadium. Club chief executive Omar Berrada said it was \"a very attractive investment opportunity\" and he was \"quite confident we'll find a way to finance the stadium\".\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire said the development can be financed because income from a \"multi-functional stadium will more than outweigh the additional interest costs\".\nKey questions, images & reaction to Man Utd's new Â£2bn stadium\nWatch The Football News Show on Man Utd's stadium plans\nConceptual images of what the new stadium and surrounding area could look like were unveiled on Tuesday by Foster and Partners\nThe stadium will shelter a public plaza that is twice the size of Trafalgar Square\nUnited say the stadium will be at the heart of a new sustainable district, which is completely walkable\nUnited say they are \"creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home\"\nThe club say the stadium has the potential to deliver Â£7.3bn a year to the UK economy\nThe 'umbrella' surrounding the stadium will harvest rainwater\nOld Trafford Regeneration Task Force chair Lord Coe says the stadium is \"the most exciting urban regeneration project in the UK since the 2012 London Olympics\"\n1 of 7\nThe stadium will form part of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area, predicted to be the biggest such project in the United Kingdom since the transformation of the Stratford area that accompanied the 2012 Olympics in London. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already given government backing to the plans.\nUnited say the entire project has the potential to create 92,000 new jobs, will involve the construction of 17,000 homes and bring an additional 1.8 million visitors to the area annually. They add the project will be worth an additional Â£7.3bn per year to the UK economy.\n\"Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest stadium,\" said Ratcliffe.\n\"Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years but it has fallen behind the arenas in world sport.\n\"I think we may well finish up with the most iconic football stadium in the world.\"\nHe said there was no date in place for when building work on the stadium would begin, adding: \"It depends how quickly the Government gets going with the regeneration programme. I think they want to get going quite quickly.\"\nThe stadium will be built using pre-fabrication, shipped in 160 components along the neighbouring Manchester Ship Canal.\nThis video can not be played\nThe north of England deserves this stadium - Ratcliffe\nCriticism of Old Trafford - England's biggest club ground with a 74,140 capacity - has grown in recent years, with issues including leaks from the roof of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.\nThe stadium has not had significant development since 2006.\nUnited have spoken to senior people involved in the most recent large-scale stadium developments, including the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and the rebuild of Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium, as part of their background work.\nThey also spoke to local residents and conducted a fan survey to establish whether supporters would prefer a new build or extensive improvements to the present stadium, which was thought likely to cost Â£1.5bn.\nFoster and Partners designed the new Wembley Stadium, which opened in 2007, and the Lusail Stadium, the venue for the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar.\nThis video can not be played\nFootball finance expert Professor Rob Wilson considers the affordability of the new stadium\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire on BBC Radio 5 Live\nIt can be done. Tottenham borrowed a huge sum of money to fund their new stadium, but they have tripled their matchday and commercial income.\nIt will be a multi-functional stadium and will more than outweigh the additional interest costs.\nPart of the payment will have to come through shares or some form of equity payment from Sir Jim Ratcliffe himself.\nUnited successfully dealt with the takeover in 2005 and their interest charges went initially over Â£100m-a-year and that was when United were a far smaller operation.\nMy big fear is that some of those costs will be used to put up prices for fans, especially season-ticket holders.\n'Some Man Utd players not good enough & overpaid'\nSir Jim Ratcliffe: The Interview\nLeaving Old Trafford will be a controversial move for some but former manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: \"Manchester United should always strive for the best in everything it does, on and off the pitch, and that includes the stadium we play in.\n\"Old Trafford holds so many memories for me personally but we must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where history can be made.\"\nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham welcomed the plans. He said: \"If we get this right, the regeneration impact could be bigger and better than London 2012.\n\"Manchester United could, and indeed should, have the best football stadium in the world.\n\"To me, that means a stadium that means a stadium that is true to the traditions of the club, affordable to all, with nobody priced out.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Iconic Man Utd goals at Old Trafford\nThe Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) says it has plenty of questions around the planned stadium.\nIt wants to know how the club will pay for the ground but says the stadium news \"could be very exciting\".\nMUST says: \"Whilst investment is much-needed and welcome, fans remain anxious about what it means and what the consequences will be.\n\"Will it drive up ticket prices and force out local fans? Will it harm the atmosphere, which is consistently fans' top priority in the ground?\n\"If they are able to produce a new stadium as stunning as the plans suggest without harming the atmosphere and hiking ticket prices this could be very exciting.\"\nFan group The 1958, which organised a protest against the club's ownership on Sunday, added that the design \"fails to reflect the club's deep-rooted heritage, traditions, and connection to its supporters\".\n\"The design resembles a generic, soulless corporate structure, more akin to a modern entertainment venue than a football cathedral,\" the group's statement added.\n\"Its circus-like aesthetic disregards the club's working-class origins and the identity of a fanbase that spans generations.\n\"Rather than honouring the past and strengthening the bond with the local community, it prioritizes spectacle over substance, alienating those who have defined United's legacy for decades.\"\nBarcelona are renovating their Nou Camp home which had a planned capacity of 105,000 when work began.

        "content": "Barry Ferguson has been appointed interim Rangers manager until the end of the season\nWas this the shortest honeymoon on record?\nFormer captain Barry Ferguson returned to Ibrox to fill the seat vacated by Philippe Clement and began with a stirring victory against Kilmarnock.\nThree days later, a home defeat against Motherwell already has the Rangers support split over Ferguson the manager.\nThat was one of the hot topics on our club pages after the weekend's action - but of course Hibernian and Heart of Midlothian fans were vocal too after the derby.\nHere is a taste of fan reaction after the Scottish Premiership action...\nThis video can not be played\n'It probably strikes his knee' - Rangers' disallowed goal\nTwo games in, the case for Ferguson...\nPaul: The end of the season can't come quick enough to clear out this underperforming Rangers team and start afresh. Give the managerial position to Barry Ferguson full-time, then we will see a team of proven fighters, diehards and winners, with the manager setting the standards from his own successful playing career at the club.\nJim: We just are not good enough... the players look frightened out there. They don't like it when the crowd gets to them. Confidence is shot. The list goes on and on. Break this team up.\nIan: Pep Guardiola or Alex Ferguson couldn't get a tune out of these players. Spineless and lack physicality all over the park. Players are not interested and show no intensity. Poor recruitment to blame. The squad has only three or four players worth keeping. God knows what Barry does with this lot.\nRuaridh: I had hoped the fight shown at Kilmarnock would still be in evidence. Sadly not though. Still toothless in attack and rocky in defence. In fairness to Barry Ferguson though, I'm sure that even a top manager would struggle to get any consistency from the current squad. We're just limping to the close season for yet more upheaval.\nLennie: Absolutely disgraceful performance again. If we play Tavernier and Propper on Thursday night against Fenerbahce, we will get hammered. Hagi was awful. We send out young Leon King on loan - he is a better player than those that played in the defence. Barry Ferguson is not a magician. Give youth a chance now, our season is over anyway.\nAnd the early case against the interim manager...\nAlistair: How did the decision to appoint an unproven stand-in manager get made? No track record of success. No stand-up good example for the players either. Barry and [Allan] McGregor blotted their copybooks on Scotland duty. Is this what we want the fans and team to look up to and respect? So wrong.\nAnonymous: Ferguson joins on Monday, interviews and press conferences every day, parading around Ibrox taking selfies, appoints his pals as coaches, but every interview he keeps on telling us, 'it's not about me, it's the team'. Gurns on the sidelines for 90 minutes then tells us they're good players. Never a manager, taking us backwards, get him binned now!\nWilliam: We're in utter limbo, the idea the so-called management team will still be here in August is laughable...\nAnonymous: No matter how good a player Barry was, he is not managerial material. Get rid of the old guard who do not have a clue.\nRab: Dreadful performance, no visible change of tactics or approach from the previous managerial regime. The team lacked the ability to deal with a simple high press employed by Motherwell. Nothing came from the coaching team, some of whom were critical of the previous manager, to counter this.\nThis video can not be played\nHibs fans celebrate back-to-back derby wins\nHibs fans were naturally in good spirits after David Gray's side made it 15 games unbeaten in all competitions with a 2-1 win against Hearts.\nBert: In November I was very critical of the club coach and players. The way that they have responded is heroic, with everyone giving full effort and commitment. Been a Hibee since 1947 and watched the 'Famous Five' until moving to New Zealand.\nPeter: After Boyle's blistering pace gave us an early lead we squandered it with pure comedy defending - second half we were so much better and Iredale's wonderful shot gave us the points and third place. Good atmosphere at the club these days, all down to the hard work of the squad and manager. Well done!\nSteven: David Gray has to be odds-on for the manager of the year award. The turnaround has been nothing short of remarkable, the unity of the squad is there for all to see. We hit rock bottom quite literally earlier this season, not once were any fans calling for Gray to go, but no-one saw the complete U-turn in fortunes. In Sir David we trust.\nKeith: Absolutely brilliant. A testimony to the effort and drive instigated by David Gray and shown by the players. Skill, tracking back (sorry Shankland), effort, team spirit, attitude. All massively improved in this run, which breeds belief and confidence. Way to go but that way is up. Keep going.\nScott: Just incredible. No Hibs supporter could have envisiged where we are now in the league - huge credit to David Gray and the players. First half we were not at our best but second half there was only one team in it. You just sensed the goal was coming and what a strike to win it. Another three points and the Hibees go marching on.\nFor Hearts fans, the derby defeat was a setback in an otherwise solid run of form and they are generally not panicking...\nPaul: All that textbook football, making three or four passes to go nowhere. That counts for nothing in the white-hot heat of a derby match. More grit, determination, passion is what's required.\nJim: As a lifelong Hearts fan I have to say Hibs deserved their win. We did not show the hunger and commitment Hibs had in abundance. We still have a 'back four' problem and are missing [Cammy] Devlin in midfield. I am not overly concerned about the team overall, taking into account our start to the season though. Inconsistency is our biggest concern - and players' passion.\nChris: Hibs just showed how frail we are at the back, something we all knew. No leaders and zero composure, we played the occasion not the game. Rookie stuff. Par for what has been a mediocre season. Got what we deserved playing like that - nothing.\nStewart: Disappointing but not a surprise. Decent first half but poor in the second. Kabangu was outmuscled and offside all day. Very poor. Priority in the summer is a dependable right-back in the mould of Michael Smith. Critchley has not won a big game yet. That's a concerning stat he needs to address. The late subs were desperate. Lost all shape."

        "title": "From Barca's most-fined player to prolific forward - Dembele's revival",
        "content": "A previous version of this column was originally published on 19 February\nOusmane Dembele has long had a big reputation.\nThe forward - who was once the second-most expensive player in history when he signed for Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund in 2017 in a deal worth Â£135 - was described by Barca president Joan Laporta as \"better than Kylian Mbappe\" in 2021.\nA week later, then Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez said he was a player who \"when used properly, could be the best player in the world\".\nTwo months on, having been told by a cash-strapped Barcelona to accept a new contract on reduced terms or leave, Xavi dropped him from the squad.\nThat story reflects his time at Barcelona, a six-year spell of inconsistency and unfulfilled potential.\nIn August 2023, the France forward was bought by Paris St-Germain for Â£43m, having scored 40 goals in 185 games and won three La Liga titles.\nNow - with 22 goals in his past 16 games - he is Europe's most in-form striker, drawing comparison to the likes of Lionel Messi, who scored 13 goals in four games in March 2012, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who hit 11 goals in four games in May 2011.\nHe is also viewed as PSG's trump card in their quest for a first Champions League trophy.\nSince the start of December, he has scored more goals than any other player in the big five European leagues.\nSo, as PSG go into Tuesday's Champions League last-16 second leg at Liverpool trailing 1-0, what has changed and can his remarkable form last?\nPSG's Ousmane Dembele is Europe's most in-form striker\nDembele arrived at Barcelona aged 20 as their most expensive signing, but his time at the club was a mix of injury setbacks and off-field issues.\nDespite being largely injury-free at Rennes and Dortmund, he sustained 14 muscle issues at the Nou Camp, spending 784 days sidelined.\nConcerns over discipline and professionalism led the club to assign private chefs to him, while late nights because of gaming affected his training punctuality, making him the club's most-fined player in recent years.\nStill, when fit, his explosive pace and dribbling made him a game-changer, as he showed glimpses of the talent Barcelona invested in.\nSo what changed him?\nThose that know him best - and few do - say he changed after marrying his girlfriend Rima at a Muslim wedding in Morocco in December 2021, and soon after he had a child.\nThe wedding came as a surprise to many of his team-mates, not least because they did not even know he had a partner.\nSo the big changes to his life occurred in his last two seasons at Barcelona when, essentially, he grew up.\nHe worked at home with a physiotherapist and frequently went to France to receive specialised preventative treatments. With the eyes and mind of a father, he began to see things differently.\nHe finally took on board the importance of good nutrition and, for the past few seasons, has employed a French nutritionist who has helped him maintain a healthier lifestyle.\nDembele always enjoyed the respect and esteem of his Barca team-mates, many of whom were surprised and disappointed to see him sold to PSG.\nDembele has never lacked confidence, is super-passionate about football and arrived in Paris in August 2023 convinced of his ability to succeed at the club, despite the presence at the time of Mbappe.\nLast summer, manager Luis Enrique told Dembele that, without Mbappe in the team, he needed more goals from him to go with his large number of assists - carte blanche for the player to show a more selfish approach with less passing and a bigger desire to score.\nIn private, the coaching staff have frequently told him that if he managed to convert a decent percentage of the chances he creates, it can lead to collective success and then individual honours. The Ballon d'Or even.\nHe has taken it all on board and is relishing playing in his new tactical role.\nLast season, he was mostly played on the right. Now he operates as a false nine, inside, where he touches the ball more, enjoys a greater freedom to receive passes and participate in the build-up but with more chances to finish.\nHe is enjoying talking about tactics, about how to improve and about understanding the game. He is now the complete opposite of how he was perceived by many at Barcelona.\nAnd the goals have flowed, his tally of 27 coming from all angles.\nThis season, he has scored 20 in Ligue 1, six in the Champions League and one in the Nations League.\nIt has not all been smooth sailing for Dembele in Paris though. Despite his quiet facade, he still has fire inside.\nIn September, following PSG's 3-1 victory over Rennes, there was a heated exchange between player and manager - leading to Dembele's exclusion from the squad for a subsequent Champions League match against Arsenal.\nLuis Enrique emphasised the importance of players fulfilling their responsibilities to the team, saying: \"When a player doesn't meet their obligations, this is the sort of thing that can happen.\n\"The best thing I did was not to play him in London against Arsenal, even though that was heavily criticised. This is my best decision of the year. He did the rest himself.\"\nDembele did not like the way he had been talked to by the manager in front of the squad and overreacted. Soon after he apologised.\nHe was also sent off against Bayern Munich and after that, spending two games on the bench, it was incorrectly suggested that Luis Enrique had punished him.\nHe was actually rested because the coach thought he was a bit unfocused and needed a mental rest. Those two games were two unexpected draws against Nantes and Auxerre.\nA few weeks ago we saw a video of training with the two men hugging and laughing.\nLuis Enrique was also full of praise for Dembele after he scored twice in the play-off first-leg win against Brest.\n\"Ask him what he has had for breakfast since Christmas! Actually those who see him regularly are not surprised,\" he said.\nFor some time many have believed that the holy grail of a Champions League triumph for PSG might be dependent on the on-field achievements of one of France's heroes.\nThat could still be the case - just not with Mbappe, but a rejuvenated Dembele.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast"

We've come a long way as a team and a club.\n\"They're mouth-watering prospects and I want the lads to enjoy it and play like we did at Huddersfield and like we have away from home recently.\n\"Reading is a great stage to play on and I feel like we've got the players who will go and embrace that.\"\nParkinson played over 350 games for Reading from 1992-2003, the final club of his playing career.\n\"I was there 11 years and it's a great club, in a bit of turmoil behind the scenes at the moment which is sad to see, but it's not the only club which goes through those periods.\n\"I've got a lot of good friends down there and my kids we born in Reading, I lived there for 11 years so I always look forward to going back.\n\"But my focus is purely on the performance level and getting it as high as we possibly can.\"\nThe fixture at the Select Car Leasing Stadium will see Sam Smith return to his former club for the first time since joining Wrexham in January.\nSmith netted the winner against Rotherham on Saturday to bag his first home goal for Wrexham having scored in a 2-0 win at Northampton Town in February.\nIt comes after Smith netted 11 goals for the Royals in the opening half of the campaign and the forward fully expects a tough test against his former employers as Wrexham seek a fifth successive away league victory.\n\"They're a very good team, young and energetic. They're fighting for the play-offs so they'll be giving everything they've got,\" he said.\n\"It's going to be very strange but I'm looking forward to going back.\n\"Incredible memories, incredible people and an incredible club.\""

        "title": "'Ineligible' Equatorial Guinea skipper cleared to play by Fifa",
        "content": "Emilio Nsue won the golden boot at Afcon 2023, scoring five goals in four games\nEquatorial Guinea's record goalscorer Emilio Nsue has been officially cleared to play for the country by Fifa - more than a decade after the former Spain youth international made his senior debut for the African nation.\nThere was widespread surprise in May last year when football's world governing body handed Nsue, now 35, a six-month ban, deeming him ineligible to play in 2026 World Cup qualifiers.\nAt the time, Fifa said it was \"comfortably satisfied\" that Nsue, who won the golden boot at last year's Africa Cup of Nations, had never received clearance to formalise his switch from Spain.\nBut that changed on Wednesday when Fifa approved a second request by Equatorial Guinea's football federation (Feguifut) - 12 years after its first attempt.\n\"Fifa's decision has been very positive for us and for all the people of Equatorial Guinea,\" Feguifut president Venancio Tomas Ndong Micha told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"After so many years, and months, we were able to show that Emilio was eligible and finally Fifa showed justice in this case.\"\nFifa's shock ruling last year came 43 games after Nsue's 2013 debut for Equatorial Guinea, a side he has often captained and for whom he has scored a record 22 goals.\nAfter he struck twice in World Cup qualifying wins against Namibia and Liberia in late 2023, Fifa ruled that both games would be forfeited 3-0.\nFeguifut was also fined 150,000 Swiss francs ($164,000, Â£129,000) for fielding the player, who had previously taken part in both the 2018 and 2022 World Cup qualifying campaigns without incident.\nThe second - and ultimately successful - bid to change Nsue's allegiance was launched shortly after his six-month ban ended, while a Feguifut appeal last year resulted in the fine being reduced to 50,000 Swiss francs, with the remaining 100,000 suspended for two years.\n\"I am overjoyed to be able to be back with my national team and to compete for the flag and people of Equatorial Guinea,\" Nsue told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"Now it is time to focus on our upcoming qualification matches for the 2026 World Cup, and hopefully we can make every Equatoguinean proud of us.\"\nNsue and Equatorial Guinea appeal eligibility ruling\nEq Guinea striker Nsue suspended for 'indiscipline'\nFifa's ruling in May 2024 stunned both Nsue and Feguifut president Ndong Micha, given neither thought his eligibility was an issue.\nIt transpired, however, that a previous Feguifut regime had failed to file the correct paperwork and follow procedure in 2013.\nHaving played nearly 50 times for Spain's youth teams, it was in February of that year that the Equatoguinean federation first wrote to Fifa requesting the change of allegiance before - despite receiving no approval - then fielding the forward in two games over four months.\nIn response, Fifa sanctioned Equatorial Guinea, awarding technical 3-0 wins to their opponents, stating that Nsue was ineligible as he did not have Equatoguinean nationality when first representing Spain in 2005 - a requirement at the time.\nFour months later, however, Nsue was back on the field for Equatorial Guinea - for a friendly against Spain, ironically - and he continued to play, including at three Nations Cups, until Fifa took its belated action.\nSpeaking to the BBC in July 2024, Ndong Micha claimed that Fifa had not taken into account his country's constitution, which states that anyone born to a mother or father from the country is automatically an Equatoguinean upon birth.\nA statement to this extent by Equatorial Guinea's minister for justice, culture and human rights was crucial in enabling Fifa's recent U-turn.\nThe fact that Nsue could show an old Equatoguinean passport from 2004, a document which preceded his first Spain youth appearance, also helped win the case.\n\"Thanks to our lawyer Paolo [Torchetti], who has been key, we have been able to show all necessary documentation relating to Emilio's eligibility,\" added Ndong Micha, calling Fifa's decision \"vital\".\nThe Central African nation now hopes its lost points can be returned as the nation of two million looks to qualify for its maiden World Cup.\nThe deduction took Equatorial Guinea, once second in Group H with nine points from four games, to second bottom in a group topped by Tunisia.\nNsue is now set to feature in this month's World Cup qualifiers at home to Sao Tome and Principe and away against Namibia.\n\"Now that Emilio has been deemed eligible to play for Equatorial Guinea, I think the World Cup points should be coming back to us in the future,\" said Ndong Micha.\n\"We want the six points as this will give us renewed hope as we fight to qualify.\"\nLiberia and Malawi are the other nations in the six-team group.\nOnly the winners will qualify automatically for the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the USA, while the four best-placed runners-up will have a second chance via the play-offs."

        "content": "Aged just 17, Lamine Yamal has contributed almost 60 goals for club and country\nAfter lighting up the European Championship last summer, Lamine Yamal is still finding new ways to amaze those watching him in action.\nThe 17-year-old wrote his name into the Champions League history books on Tuesday night, becoming the youngest player ever to score and assist in the competition as he helped Barcelona beat Benfica to reach the quarter-finals.\nThis season he has contributed to 28 goals, and is approaching 60 goal contributions for club and country.\nAnd just to emphasise - he is only 17.\nThe teenager plays with a confidence that belies his years, exemplified by the quality of his assist and goal against Benfica.\nFollowing a mazy run towards the visitors' box, he flicked a brilliant ball through the defence to find Raphinha at the far post to volley in.\nThen it was his turn to get on the scoresheet, and he did so in spectacular fashion. With space on the edge of the box, Yamal effortlessly whipped a brilliant strike beyond the reach of the goalkeeper and into the far corner.\n\"His goal was spectacular,\" said team-mate Raphinha.\n\"It shows what Lamine is - he's a spectacular player with tremendous quality.\"\nBarcelona beat Benfica 3-1 on the night and 4-1 on aggregate to go through to the last eight, where they will face either Borussia Dortmund or Lille.\n\"Lamine hadn't scored for a long time, six games and over a month, so he's happy because it was a very important goal for us, a brilliant effort,\" Barcelona manager Hansi Flick said.\n\"We are all happy for him because he is a great kid and a fantastic player.\"\nBefore Barcelona's last-16 second-leg against Benfica, former England midfielder Owen Hargreaves likened Yamal's emergence to that of a teenage Wayne Rooney, who burst on to the scene with Everton aged 16.\nRooney went on to become Manchester United's all-time top scorer and also led the scoring charts for England, until he was surpassed by Harry Kane.\n\"I've never seen a 17-year-old that consistent,\" Hargreaves said on TNT Sports.\n\"You see players have flashes. I think back to seeing Wayne Rooney and thought he was out of this world, but this kid is just unbelievable.\n\"He scores goals, creates goals, and he makes it look incredibly easy. The best 17-year-old I've seen.\"\nYamal played 50 games for Barcelona last season and has made 36 appearances this term, showing he is an integral player for the club already.\nBut former Liverpool and England winger Steve McManaman warned against burning him out at a young age.\nHe said: \"You just have to be careful because we saw it with Pedri, playing a lot, saw it with Ansu Fati, Gavi, and they had horrific injuries from then on between the ages of 18 to 20 and it really affected them.\n\"I think he's at the right place because Barcelona are used to nurturing players. My only concern is injuries. I hope I'm not talking in a year's time saying he's got a bad injury, because that has happened at Barcelona.\n\"He's too good to be missing from the football field.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964.\nSixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer.\nJohn White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching.\nTottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers.\nRob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father.\nHis search has continued ever since.\nPat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964\nRob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors.\nThe day he knows best in his father's life is the last.\nIt is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path.\nOn the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane.\nHaving finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery.\nJohn White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'.\nBill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him.\nWhite (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators\nThat was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business.\nAfter training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home.\nWhen John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank.\nJohn eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf.\nHis young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued.\nDelay heaped on delay. The sky darkened.\nA compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him?\n\"As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,\" says Rob.\n\"The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'\"\nMarchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course.\n\"I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,\" says Rob. \"Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time.\"\nThe White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra\nThe landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar.\nEach handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights.\nAt one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose.\nAnd all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top.\nIt is a film from 1962 â a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external\nJohn White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster.\nFor Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years.\nThe first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box.\n\"It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,\" Rob says.\n\"As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff.\n\"It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline.\"\nWhite and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley\nJust as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy.\nRob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life.\nIn the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about â a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle.\n\"Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,\" says Rob.\n\"Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right.\"\nFor Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps.\nJohn's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era.\nPeople shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage.\nUsually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious â an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance.\nTottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right)\nToo often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from.\n\"He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,\" Rob says.\n\"Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that.\n\"There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration.\"\nRob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth.\nAnd gradually he found him.\nRob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra.\n\"Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,\" says Rob.\n\"To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life.\n\"If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers.\"\nJohn's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have.\nRob is a still-life photographer - \"I have always been looking for those details and clues\" - and is also training as a counsellor.\nLater this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.\nThe staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.\n\"It is something I talk about with my own therapist,\" he says. \"Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project.\n\"I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life.\"\nAfter two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external\nThere are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive.\nBut over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.\nWhite is an avid Tottenham fan and lives less than half a mile from Tottenham Stadium\nFuelling the Tour de France: Secrets of the team kitchens\nPanenka - the penalty that killed a career and started a feud\nThe people v Andy Murray: Four weeks that changed him and us\nRunning on a volcano's rim - the race in the shadow of an eruption\nThe awkward questions behind Hungary's football revival"

        "content": "This video can not be played\n'Performance of his life' - Alisson's Paris heroics\nIt was the ultimate smash and grab.\nLiverpool were on the ropes for 87 minutes against Paris St-Germain at the Parc des Princes, but Harvey Elliott struck 46 seconds after coming on as a substitute to secure a 1-0 first-leg advantage for the Reds in their last-16 tie.\nThe hosts could, and should, have been out of sight as they peppered the Liverpool goal throughout - having 27 attempts compared to just two for the visitors.\nBut PSG found Brazil goalkeeper Alisson in otherworldly form, with the 32-year-old repelling everything that came his way to frustrate the French champions.\nHis nine saves were the most by a Liverpool goalkeeper in a Champions League game since Opta started recording the data in 2003-04.\n\"It was probably the performance of my life,\" Alisson told TNT Sports.\n\"The manager was telling us how hard it would be to play against PSG, how good they are with the ball and that we would have to be ready to suffer.\n\"We knew what was coming.\"\nElliott said of his team-mate: \"He is unbelievable, the best in the world.\n\"In each and every game he shows it and keeps us in many games. Without him I don't know where we would be.\"\nThis video can not be played\nElliot gives Liverpool dramatic win in Paris\nPSG fans will still be wondering just how their side did not win this game.\nIndeed, when Elliott scored there was an air of disbelief, the supporters inside the ground struggling to comprehend what had just happened given how dominant the hosts had been.\nHere are some stats which highlight PSG's supremacy:\nLiverpool scored with their only shot on target\nPSG had 27 shots in this match - the second-most on record (since 2003-04) by a side in a Champions League knockout match in which they both failed to score and lost, behind only PSG themselves v Borussia Dortmund in May 2024 (30)\nLiverpool won this match despite having 25 fewer shots than PSG (two to 27) - the joint-largest negative difference in shots by a winning team on record (since 2003-04) in a Champions League knockout game (PSG v Bayern in April 2021 also 25, six shots to 31)\nThe Reds faced 20-plus shots in a Champions League knockout match for only the fifth time on record - on all four previous occasions they had conceded at least one goal\nAlisson's nine saves beat his own record of most saves in a Liverpool Champions League match (eight v Tottenham in the 2019 final).\n'We were far superior' - Enrique insists PSG 'deserved more'\nElliott scores Liverpool winner in PSG smash and grab\nAlisson has been at Liverpool since 2018 and has had many memorable displays - but this must rank at the very top.\nPSG have been in sensational form since the turn of the year and were looking to extend their unbeaten record to 23 games on Wednesday.\nThey were dominant from the first minute as the visitors struggled to get out of their own half and it seemed only a matter of time before the French side took the lead.\nLiverpool did ride their luck as a couple of early decisions went in their favour, but Alisson ultimately proved to be the difference.\nHe pulled off sensational saves to deny a host of PSG players including Ousmane Dembele (twice), Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (four times) and substitute Desire Doue (twice).\nThis shot map shows the number of efforts PSG had against Liverpool (right), compared to the Reds' two attempts\n\"[Liverpool] got away with it because of Alisson,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\"You buy those type of players for performances like that. That's how you win titles, that's how they won the Champions League [in 2019].\n\"Alisson is so key to the way they perform. He is superb at reading situations. His decision-making is exceptional.\"\nIt was a performance that underlined Alisson's position as the Reds' number one goalkeeper, although he will get fresh competition for next season.\nGeorgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili will join in the summer from La Liga side Valencia and, according to reports,, external has his sights set on becoming first choice.\nLiverpool also have Caoimhin Kelleher, who has always stepped up superbly whenever Alisson has been absent through injury, but the Republic of Ireland man's long-term future at the club is uncertain.\n\"I don't think that I have ever worked with a goalkeeper at this level before, which is normal because he is the best in the world,\" Liverpool boss Arne Slot said of Alisson.\n\"I have had some very good players as a manager but never the best goalkeeper in the world until now.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'By a heel' - VAR rules Kvaratskhelia's goal offside\nAs well as being perplexed at how their side lost, PSG fans will also feel aggrieved at some decisions that went against them early on.\nKvaratskhelia had a fine goal in the first half disallowed by the video assistant referee (VAR) for a marginal offside.\nIbrahima Konate was also fortunate not to be sent off after a last-man challenge on Bradley Barcola.\nReferee Davide Massa decided it was not a foul at the time and, after a check, VAR opted against overruling the official.\nBut aside from Alisson's heroics, PSG were also wasteful with 17 of their 27 attempts failing to hit the target.\n\"In the first half [PSG] were great and the thing that was missing was goals,\" said former Man City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Champions League Match of the Day.\n\"The fluidity of the front three is so impressive. Whenever they got the ball they were looking to run at Liverpool, trying to glide past defenders and break into key areas to try to make chances.\n\"Unfortunately the final part, the most important part, was getting the ball in the net and that was missing.\"\nSlot added: \"If you look at the underlying stats in the Champions League too it shows you they were number one, and they have already played Atletico Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Arsenal. To have the best stats after facing that quality tells you a lot.\n\"For us the only way over here with their fans behind them was to defend as we did. Now we are hoping that our fans at Anfield will help us a lot. We will need Anfield two times.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone"

The officials for the matches will be announced on Tuesday.\nThe Premier League Match Centre account on X has posted \"near-live\" explanations of VAR decisions this season, but this will be the first time spoken announcements have been given to crowds, if there are any such calls to make.\nThe EFL said in a statement: \"The new pilot embraces technological advancements for the benefit of match officials and fans.\n\"This latest pilot has the support of the EFL and follows earlier collaboration with PGMOL in 2018 to trial VAR in EFL competitions ahead of its introduction in the Premier League.\"\n'VAR is a poor experience for fans at games'\nVAR decisions explained on X - what else is new?\nThis is a first for English football but we do have a template for this trial, which suggests expectations should be kept to a minimum.\nThere will be no real-time cricket-style audio of discussions taking place in the VAR booth. There will be no explanations of what was in the referee's mind when he made a decision, and what was in the VAR's when they requested a review.\nIf matches taking place in Fifa competitions that initially trialled this system are any guide, what we will get is the referee explaining what the decision is, which we would obviously get to know pretty quickly anyway.\nPGMOL head of refereeing Howard Webb would like to go further but is bound by the game's worldwide rule-making body, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which has shown no real appetite for trialling real-time audio.\nOne day, maybe many years from now, it will come.

I felt there was only going to be one winner - Hearts just didn't have the answers.\n\"David Gray will be delighted with the run they are going on leading into the split and everybody in the place has a buzz about them.\n\"I find it very hard to find a side who are going to give Hibs a going over.

        "content": "Alan Sheehan has claimed 18 points from 10 games across his two spells as Swansea's caretaker boss\nAlan Sheehan's future looks set to be decided next week with Swansea City's caretaker boss due to discuss the way ahead with director of football Richard Montague.\nSwansea are unbeaten in three games since Sheehan took the reins following the departure of Luke Williams.\nSheehan's team have claimed notable home wins over Blackburn Rovers and Middlesbrough as well as a battling draw at Preston North End.\nSwansea will look to continue their good form at Watford on Wednesday and when high-flying Burnley visit next Saturday in the final fixture before the international break.\nSheehan will then sit down with Montague, who is leading the search for Williams' permanent successor, to decide what comes next.\nWhile one option for Swansea could be to delay the appointment of a new management team until the end of the season, Sheehan has played down the chances of that happening because the club are working with a depleted group of staff following the exits of Williams, Ryan Harley and George Lawtey.\n\"We have had conversations along those lines,\" he said.\n\"I don't think that's the right thing because we've lost a good few staff - we have staff filling in.\n\"It's quite demanding. I like it to be demanding but in terms of continuing it on, you need to have permanent roles for permanent people with a permanent plan, [to] know where the club is going.

What way do we want to play, how do we want to evolve it?\n\"There are all these questions but everyone needs to be on the same page. It can't be loose, one person thinking this, me wanting that, you want this, you want that.\"\nSheehan said he was flattered by chants from sections of the home crowd supporting him following the Middlesbrough triumph.\nThe former left-back has stressed that he and his family are happy living in Wales â but has also made it clear that he wants a chance to achieve in the dugout.\n\"There's no point being a manager and just surviving,\" Sheehan added.\n\"You want to be able to do something, you want to go and win because I love winning and I'll do certain things to win.\n\"There are a lot of conversations to be had and see where we want to get to.\""

        "title": "Ismael in place at Ewood with clear short-term goal",
        "content": "It's a fifth spell in English football for Valerien Ismael - his fourth as a head coach following his time as a Crystal Palace player more than 25 years ago.\nHe's been out of management for just under a year after a 40-match tenure at Watford came to end in March 2024 and inherits a Blackburn Rovers team that sits sixth with a dozen games to go.\nThe contract might be long-term (three years), but the short-term objective is clear - secure a play-off spot.\nIf Ismael achieves that, he will be first of the 10 appointments made under Venky's ownership to do so.\nThis is an appointment that at the start of February just wasn't on the radar. John Eustace was navigating a sticky spell in terms of results but all appeared calm. But as soon as Derby came calling, Rovers were powerless to keep him. The last couple of weeks have been all about finding the right man.\nAfter more than 100 expressions of interest and the bookmakers favourite changing on a regular basis, a shortlist was drawn up.\nCEO Steve Waggott working alongside chief operating officer Suhail Shaikh and head of football operations Rudy Gestede all tasked with whittling down the candidates in to a far more manageable number.\nInitial phone conversations were followed by meetings held remotely before the face-to-face discussions took place to find the right man.\nIsmael's experience of the second tier has undoubtedly helped his application. His role at Barnsley, albeit four years ago, could have swung the vote - 25 wins from 44 games and a very strong second half to the season secured a play-off spot where in the end they succumbed to Swansea.\nThe Frenchman would often make substitutions relatively early. He wasn't afraid to make a raft of them at half-time or certainly before the hour mark.\nIt's certainly something that Eustace introduced to his team this year, citing how it had gained the Tykes the edge over others in the play-off race in 2021.\nHis leading scorer in that play-off campaign was Cauley Woodrow, now with Blackburn. Another Rovers player, Callum Brittain was also part of that team, missing only six games all year.\nBoth will know what to expect going forward as will Emmanuel Dennis who played under Ismael at Watford last season.\nThe club where it didn't work out in England for him was West Bromwich Albion. A run of one win in eight was enough to see him leave in February 2022 with the Baggies unable to readjust to his methods and style of play. The feeling was that the football on show just didn't cut it.\nA quick look at Ismael's CV shows that longevity is missing. A 50-match spell in charge of Austrian side LASK is his longest to date. Undoubtedly, he'd have gone well past that mark at Barnsley had he not left to join the Baggies, but nonetheless it is worthy of note.\nThe club statement mentions his core principles of respect, discipline, commitment and hard work. If he has the much talked about new manager bounce, it could be enough.\nA dozen games to play, six at home and six away - whether the season extends beyond the final day visit to Sheffield United remains to be seen."

If found guilty, Osmajic faces a minimum ban of six games.\nParker said of the investigation: \"It probably is taking a bit of time. It is a serious allegation with a lot of investigating that needs to go on.\"\nPreston manager Paul Heckingbottom said he had picked Osmajic after talks with the player.\n\"If he wouldn't have been up for it [he would have been left out],\" Heckingbottom said after the game.\n\"He was fine - he wanted to be involved.

        "title": "From almost quitting football to Ballon d'Or hope - Raphinha's rebirth",
        "content": "On his 18th birthday, Raphinha sat alone in his tiny room in Florianopolis, staring at his phone. No messages. No calls. No offers. Injured and out of the Avai U20 team, he was on the verge of giving up.\nFootball had been his escape from the favelas of Brazil's Porto Alegre, but now it felt like a dead end. His dream was slipping away and for the first time - although by no means the last - he wondered if he was chasing something that wasn't meant for him.\nThen came the voice that changed everything. His mother, always his fiercest supporter, refused to let him quit. \"If you stop now,\" she told him, \"you'll have to live with this for the rest of your life. Are you ready for that?\"\nThat moment became his turning point. Fast forward to today, and the same player who nearly walked away from football is now at the heart of Barcelona's revival, delivering goals and defying expectations.\nRaphinha's journey from Porto Alegre to Barcelona's dressing room is a story of resilience, discipline, and continuous self-improvement. His transformation into a top-level performer is not just about talent. It's about mindset, sacrifice, and an unwavering desire to succeed.\nShould Barcelona somehow manage to win this inaugural season of the new-look Champions League, it will also be a personal triumph for the 28-year-old, who as recently as last summer was cast in the role of sacrificial lamb in Barcelona's attempt to bring in Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.\nHe again showed his worth in Tuesday's last-16 second leg against Benfica, scoring twice to help send Barca through to the quarter-finals.\nPlot the route to Champions League glory - who is your winner?\nPlay BBC Sport's new Champions League game\nRaphinha was raised in the relentless, grinding poverty seen across the sprawling shanty towns that litter the landscape in and around the neighbourhood of Restinga in the city of Porto Alegre.\nIn a neighbourhood where violence and drug trafficking are often a way of life, Raphael Dias Belloli knew from an early age that football was not just a way out - it was the only way out.\nHe has spoken about how he saw talented friends take the wrong path. Unlike them, he had the support of his family, especially his mother and uncle, who encouraged him to keep pushing forward with sport despite financial struggles.\nHis mother worked tirelessly, and his family made sacrifices to buy him football boots and pay for his transport to training sessions.\nHis football education was all about survival; playing barefoot against older opponents in the streets helped him develop endurance and technical skills under pressure. Both would become his most defining traits.\nHe was initially rejected by clubs like Internacional and Gremio because they considered him too thin and lightweight for professional football.\nDespite these setbacks, the rejection fuelled his competitive spirit and obsession with proving people wrong. Eventually he got a chance at Avai, a smaller club with a solid youth system where he learnt to handle the physical side of the game before having to face the first of many crises.\nA serious injury at Avai's U20 team left him sidelined and questioning his footballing future. The turning point came when his mother reminded him in no uncertain terms that giving up would mean having to find a 'proper' job.\nFrom that moment, his commitment to discipline and sacrifice became absolute, he started seeing football not just as a passion but his only way to a better life.\nUnlike many Brazilian stars who first shine at major domestic clubs, Raphinha had to prove himself in Europe from the bottom up.\nIn Portugal, first with Vitoria Guimaraes and then Sporting, he showed his ability to beat defenders and create chances, while at Rennes he proved he could be a game changer.\nHe was catching the eyes of the bigger clubs and, fortunately for him, he attracted the attention of the hardest of taskmasters that is Marcelo Bielsa, who took him to Leeds and rapidly accelerated his development albeit via a harsh, unforgiving regime.\nIt was there that he developed an outstanding physical endurance, which made his explosive playing style sustainable, improved his off-the-ball movement and pressing intensity and learned to move intelligently without the ball.\nHe also caught the attention of Barcelona who signed him on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of Â£50m, potentially rising to Â£55 million in add-ons.\nRaphinha struggled initially playing for an elite club.\nCoach Xavi saw him more as a squad member than as an undisputed starter and even when he started to be a regular in the line up, he rarely played full games.\nBarcelona's inability to buy without selling first due to financial issues put him firmly in the frame as the club's biggest playing asset and the player most likely to be sold - especially while Barcelona were trying to sign Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams last summer.\nFocus was also elsewhere with the precocious and outrageously talented Lamine Yamal the centre of everyone's attention and effectively undroppable.\nIn two seasons at the club, Raphinha was used off the bench 11 times and started just 42 times out of a possible 76.\nThe message coming out of Barcelona was simple. \"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go,\" seemed to be the gist of it.\nRaphinha had other ideas, although it was a close-run thing.\n\"There were several moments, not just one [when I considered leaving],\" he admits now.\n\"There was a lot of self-doubt. I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so to speak, so that pressure made me think about leaving.\"\nHansi Flick was appointed Barcelona head coach in May 2024\nThe dismissal of manager Xavi in May and subsequent appointment of Hansi Flick changed everything.\nThe German coach gave him a bigger role and allowed him to play with confidence. He is now a player reborn.\nFlick focused his work on the importance of making smarter decisions, knowing when to dribble, when to pass. The more direct style suited him too.\nThese days he loses the ball less and is more efficient and composed in front of goal. His current stats are remarkable.\nHe has 26 goals and 19 assists in 40 games and has scored in every match he has played in the Champions League this season.  He has established himself as one of Barcelona's key players and a genuine Ballon d'Or contender.\nHe has also been voted as one of the team captains, receiving the fourth-highest tally of votes behind Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Ronald Araujo and Frenkie de Jong. When they were injured he became the club's outright skipper.\nLamine Yamal, who also played a starring role in Tuesday's win over Benfica, has publicly said Raphinha is his main mentor in the squad.\nThat complements well with the fact that with the Brazilian national team he is the undisputed number one leader in the group.\nHis last-minute winner in the club's pulsating 4-5 group stage win in Benfica was a key moment in his and the club's season.\nHis celebration, with Barca's entire bench running towards him in the pouring rain, became a symbolic image of the team's unity and cemented his status as a dressing room leader.\nHe is clearly one of the most-respected voices in the dressing room, not overly vocal, but rather a leader by example, not just in matches but just as importantly in training.\nRaphinha knows just how hard it has been for him to get where he is today, just how fickle footballing fate can be and that it is primarily during your most successful times that you find yourself closest to failure.\nTo that end he leaves nothing to chance. He has spoken openly about how he avoids distractions outside football.\nHe has no interest in nightlife or partying, preferring to spend time at home with his family or focusing on training. It is this discipline that has been key to raising him to his physical and mental peak.\nAnd now he has reached this point, there is no stopping him and if Barcelona go far in the Champions League, nobody should argue his right to be considered one of the top players in the world.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast"

It was a wonderful experience.\"\nMuslic proud Argyle pushed 'one of the best teams in the world'\nFacing Guardiola 'biggest honour of my life' - Muslic\nFrom refugee to coach - the man behind Plymouth's upset of Liverpool\nBefore his side's 3-1 loss to the seven-time Cup winners, Muslic had told how he revered the Spaniard as one of the best coaches in world football.\nPlymouth - who are second from bottom of the Championship - impressed in the defeat, taking the lead and only falling behind with 14 minutes to go against the reigning Premier League champions.\nIt brought to an end an amazing cup run for the second-tier strugglers, who won 1-0 at Brentford in the third round before upsetting runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool by the same score last month.\nAnd even though their careers could not be further apart - former Spain midfielder Guardiola has led Barcelona and City to Champions League glory while Muslic spent much of his time as a player in lower-league Austrian football before going into coaching - the Argyle boss says there was a strong connection between them.\n\"It was just a mix of everything because in this case we are still colleagues, even though this guy has won purely everything in world sport and I nothing,\" Muslic said.\n\"The whole staff was there and we just had a really beautiful time - when Pep is speaking, you have to listen and I think we all listened.\"\nMiron Muslic and Pep Guardiola shared some good moments on the touchline\nMuslic hopes the connection he made can stand him and, more importantly, Argyle in good stead in future.\nThe Pilgrims have been a good staging post for a number of young Premier League players who have gone on to have good careers so forging a bond with a club such as Manchester City would be beneficial.\n\"It's football and this is a very small world and in the end a relationship and connections are very, very important,\" Muslic added.\n\"Good people are always easy to connect, so maybe this can be also a benefit for the future for Argyle.\"\nBut now the dust has settled on a famous FA Cup run, attention turns back to the league.\nPlymouth Argyle's players have to refocus as they aim to stay in the Championship\nThe Pilgrims opted to stay in the north of England after the cup tie rather than return home before their game at Hull City on Tuesday night.\nThe game has huge relegation ramifications for both sides - the Tigers are three points above Argyle and have a superior goal difference so defeat on Humberside would be a huge blow for Plymouth and Muslic.\nBut, should Argyle claim a first away league win this season, it would further boost the belief of a team that looked doomed when Wayne Rooney left as manager on New Year's Eve, with the side bottom of the table having won just once in 14 games.\n\"I'm very happy this beautiful journey is behind us so we can refocus and find the right balance again to bounce back,\" Muslic said.\nAnd he hopes for a repeat of the kind of result they produced after their previous cup tie, when they followed up beating Liverpool by thrashing Millwall 5-1.\n\"Just three days later we needed to rebalance ourselves after that historical win and historical day to face Millwall and to be again super competitive,\" Muslic recalled.\n\"The lads managed to do this in a very, very strong way and I think we need to have the same approach for Tuesday and also for Saturday.\n\"The FA Cup gave us a lot and we should take all these good things, the benefit of the FA Cup, into this competition [the Championship].\n\"If we can manage to do this, we will be again very hard to play.\""

        "content": "The Football Associations of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have expressed their intention to submit a joint bid to host the 2035 Women's World Cup.\nThe announcement follows a decision by world governing body Fifa which recommended the tournament is hosted in Europe or Africa in that year.\nBids for the 2031 and 2035 finals will have to be submitted in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nThe United States are the favourites to host the 2031 tournament after pulling out of the vote for 2027, which was won by Brazil.\nNetflix has already secured the rights in the US to show live coverage in both of those years.\nIn the UK, the Women's World Cup is one of the 'crown jewel' sporting events which must be offered to free-to-air broadcasters.\nThe 2023 World Cup was shown on the BBC and ITV, with a peak audience of 12 million viewers watching Spain's victory over England in the final.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said any bid will have the UK government's \"full support\".\n\"Football is and always will be at the core of our country's identity,\" he added. \"That pride was on full display when England hosted the Women's Euro 2022. It not only showed the best of our nation to the world but inspired a generation of girls into the game, all whilst boosting the economy.\"\nA UK bid in 2035 could reportedly face a challenge from South Africa, who also withdrew from the race to host the 2027 event.\nStatements from the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs on Wednesday expressed their delight at being part of a joint bid.\n\"We strongly believe that we could organise a fantastic tournament, building on the success of the Women's Euros in 2022 and the subsequent rapid growth of the women's game in England,\" said FA chief executive Mark Bullingham.\nHis counterpart at the Scottish FA, Ian Maxwell, added that it would be \"part of a 10-year journey to accelerate the women's game at grassroots, domestic and international levels\".\nThe UK has enjoyed success in recent years in hosting European football tournaments, but a World Cup has proven elusive.\nThe men's Euro 2028 is being played across England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland, while England and Scotland held Euro 2020 games, with the final at Wembley in July 2021 because of Covid-related delays.\nThe last major tournament held in the UK was the Women's Euro 2022, when England defeated Germany in front of 87,192 fans in the Wembley final and helped further elevate the profile of the women's game.\nWhile England hosted a men's World Cup in 1966, the UK has never hosted the women's tournament.\nThe past two bids by England for the men's World Cup both failed.\nThe 2018 bid attracted only one vote other than its own Fifa executive committee member, while in 2006 England were knocked out in the second round again with only two votes.\nThe UK's chances of securing the 2035 Women's World Cup are seen as much stronger, with decisions now taken by all 211 member nations.\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page"
